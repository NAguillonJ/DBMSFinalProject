168266,0,tertiary,42,"Like so many Americans approaching retirement, Virginia Republican Rep. Scott Rigell dreams about spending a little more time on the water. â€I have a little rowboat called Miss Nelly. Sheâ€™s 13 feet long, and thereâ€™s not a motor on it. Thereâ€™s no radio on it. And Iâ€™m so looking forward to being on that rowboat,â€ says Rigell. Rigell is retiring after just six years in Congress. He was one of the 87 Republicans who rode the Tea Party wave to a pivotal GOP takeover of the House. At the end of this Congress, more than   of that class will be gone from the U. S. House. Like many of those freshman lawmakers, Rigell had never held any public office before he arrived in Washington. Before he took office, Rigell was a car salesman. He ran as an â€outsiderâ€ in a year when voters were tired of political insiders. As it turns out, some people who never harbored ambitions to be career politicians donâ€™t love being politicians. â€I think, for many of us in my class, it truly wasnâ€™t on the bucket list of life to be here. It wasnâ€™t as if I was a junior in high school saying, â€™I want to be a member of Congress,â€™ â€ Rigell says"
168266,1,secondary,78," members of his class have already left, although two of them now serve in the Senate: Cory Gardner of Colorado and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Three more House Republicans are running for the Senate this year. Another eight members of the class are retiring. The retiring lawmakers include a farmer, a decorated Army veteran and a construction company owner. â€Iâ€™ve had better jobs than this,â€ retiring Michigan Rep. Dan Benishek says with a chuckle. â€Itâ€™s amazing to me how people are like, â€™Oh, Iâ€™ve got to run for Congress. Thatâ€™s going to be the best.â€™ I donâ€™t know. I never really felt that way.â€ Benishek was a surgeon before he came to Congress. He says voters frustrated at Washington should cheer these lawmakersâ€™ decisions to retire after a few years. Itâ€™s like   term limits  â€”   and Benishek says that means fewer career politicians. â€There is a lot of turnover in Congress. Despite what people say about people staying forever, thatâ€™s not really the case. I think people didnâ€™t realize how much turnover there is in general,â€ he says. Wisconsin Rep. Reid Ribble ran his familyâ€™s roofing company before he won in 2010. Heâ€™s retiring to spend more time with his family, but he conceded this: â€It would be disingenuous to say Iâ€™m not also frustrated with the work here.â€ Ribble and his retiring colleagues say they are, for the most part, proud of what a   House managed to get done these past six years. He cited making the Bush tax cuts permanent, new restraints on federal spending, and updated education and highway laws. â€These were fairly significant things that we got done while we were here, so some of us are saying, â€™OK, we can go home,â€™ â€ he says. Rigell agrees. He says heâ€™s grateful for his time in Washington but, in a lengthy interview in his office, he keeps coming back to a nagging concern that the Tea Party class  â€”   and the years since  â€”   will also be remembered for another reason. â€Well, Iâ€™d say we were right at the cusp of when the American political system started to come unhinged. And itâ€™s unfortunate,â€ he says. Rigell says he wants to continue work in his     life to inject more civility in American politics. There may be more job opportunities for that off Capitol Hill."
167939,2,tertiary,242,"Lots of people are fuming about Nina, an upcoming biopic about legendary singer Nina Simone. According to its critics, the filmmakers butcher important parts of Simoneâ€™s biography (in part, by attributing much of her success to the men in her life) but that their larger sin was casting actress Zoe Saldana, who plays the lead role with the help of   makeup and a prosthetic nose. Many argue that casting the lighter skinned   actress, rather than someone who better resembled Simone, was an attempt to make the film more marketable instead of staying true to the singer and the life that inspired her art. The makeup and prosthetic nose, they also charge, were sloppy and poorly executed. In one of the more gentle critiques, singer India. Arie called the casting move â€tone deaf.â€ Others went with â€disrespectful,â€ â€deplorable,â€ and â€embarrassing.â€ Buzzfeed rounded up some of the Twitter reactions to the filmâ€™s trailer. Jezebel highlighted the overwhelmingly white team behind the production. Time magazine talked to Simoneâ€™s daughter, Lisa Simone Kelly, about the movieâ€™s narrative flaws, and the Guardian chronicled some of the offensive backlash to peopleâ€™s complaints about the film. Vox also voxsplained the whole controversy, from   to the release of the first trailer. But more than any other,   Coatesâ€™ recently published essay seems to capture the full emotional depth of all this frustration. He suggests this wasnâ€™t just another questionable casting choice involving a person of color in a long line of such casting choices. To explain, Coates gets personal: â€When I was kid, I knew what the worst parts of me were â€”  my hair and my mouth. My hair was nappy. My lips were big. Nearly every kid around me knew something similar of themselves because nearly every one of us had some sort of physical defect â€”  dark skin, nappy hair, broad nose, full lips â€”  that opened us up to ridicule from one another. That each of these â€defectsâ€ were representative of all the Africa that ran through us was never lost on anyone. â€Africaâ€ was an insult â€”  African   African   etc. Ethiopian famine jokes were all the rage back then. .. . ..[Nina] Simone was in possession of nearly every feature that we denigrated as children. And yet somehow she willed herself into a goddess.â€ Coates goes on to explain how Simoneâ€™s appearance, as well as her music, helped him view his childhood musings on race in a larger context: â€Simone is something more than a female Bob Marley. It is not simply the voice: It is the world that made that voice, all the hurt and pain of denigration, forged into something otherworldly. That voice, inevitably, calls us to look at Nina Simoneâ€™s face, and for a brief moment, understand that the hate we felt, that the mockery we dispensed, was unnatural, was the fruit of conjurations and the shadow of plunder. We look at Nina Simoneâ€™s face and the lie is exposed and we are shamed. We look at Nina Simoneâ€™s face and a terrible truth comes into view â€”  there was nothing wrong with her. But there is something deeply wrong with us.â€ Finally, Coates takes us through what all of this means, both for the potential audience and Ninaâ€™s creators: â€Itâ€™s here that the term â€™appropriationâ€™ bears some usage. Weâ€™re not talking about someone inspired by the deeper lessons of Simoneâ€™s life and her music. We are talking about people who think itâ€™s fine to profit off her music while heedlessly contributing to the kind of pain that brought that music into being. To acknowledge that pain, to consider it in casting, would be inconvenient â€”  as   action always is. It would mean giving an opportunity to someone whoâ€™s actively experienced the kind of pain that plagued Simone. That would doubtlessly mean a diminished chance at garnering funds for such a film. And that, in turn, would court years of delays and the possibility of the film never coming into being. That would be unfortunate â€”  but less so for Nina Simone than for the agents who feel themselves entitled to profit her story.â€ The whole piece is worth reading and thinking about.

164667,3,tertiary,99,"Grocery stores in America have changed from neighborhood corner markets to   chains that sell convenience  â€”   along with thousands of products  â€”   to satisfy the demand of the countryâ€™s hungry consumers. What caused this transformation? And what will our grocery stores be like in the future?   food writer Michael Ruhlman, author of more than 20 books  â€”   including the   The Soul of the Chef and   of The French Laundry Cookbook with chef Thomas Keller  â€”   examines this phenomenon through the story of the Midwestern grocery chain Heinenâ€™s. His new book, Grocery: The Buying and Selling of Food in America, not only offers insights on how we produce, distribute and buy food, but seeks ways of understanding our changing relationship with what we eat and how we get it. To talk about some of these issues, NPRâ€™s Ari Shapiro of All Things Considered met with Ruhlman at a Harris Teeter grocery store in Washington, D. C. Weâ€™re going to dig into the store and wander around its various sections. But just standing here at the entrance, you can see a bit of produce, a bit of prepared food, a magazine rack, charcoal. Is there something you didnâ€™t know before you started researching the book that you now see in a different way? The sheer quantity of stuff that we buy and thatâ€™s available to us. It represents the extraordinary luxury that Americans have at our fingertips, seven days a week. We are in the first section that most people usually walk into in a grocery store: produce. It was so interesting to read about the time that you spent with the produce buyers behind Heinenâ€™s  â€”   the chain in Cleveland  â€”   and the debates they had about whether the cantaloupes were sweet enough, whether there were enough plums, whether anybody would buy the stone fruit after    in September . .. the things that we as customers never see. We donâ€™t. We just expect it to be here: â€I want peapods for my   tonight. Where are they, I expect them to be here.â€ And [the store] wants you to have them. If you come there and they donâ€™t have peapods, theyâ€™re going to lose a customer. The business is run at such a narrow margin that they really want to keep their customers, which is why youâ€™re almost always asked at good grocery stores, â€Did you find everything you need?â€ Because thatâ€™s one reason why people donâ€™t come back. Letâ€™s work our way to the packaged stuff in the center. In a typical grocery store, how many different products are you going to find? There are about 40, 000. In the past couple of decades itâ€™s gone up from about 7, 000. Food manufacturers have found that they can increase demand and sell more products if they give you more variety. For instance, barbecue sauces: Caribbean jerk, sesame ginger, Hawaiian, teriyaki . .. whenâ€™s it going to end? Thereâ€™s got to be a limit as to how much we can actually absorb and choose from. I get the sense that you feel a little conflicted. On one hand, the grocery store is the embodiment of the greatest pinnacle of human achievement, and on the other hand, itâ€™s row after row of depressing, processed,   junk. Yes. Itâ€™s the best of America and the worst of America right here in one bright   landscape. My father died shortly before I started [researching the book]. He loved grocery stores, and thatâ€™s part of why I [did this.] I think the grocery store is sort of a nostalgic place. We want to think the people who care about our food care about us. It goes back to that corner grocery store. But I donâ€™t think they do anymore. So far, it doesnâ€™t seem like grocery delivery has really taken off. Do you see that changing? I do believe more people will get their commodity groceries  â€”   the Cheerios, the cranberry juice, all the stuff in the middle of the grocery store they will get it delivered, because itâ€™s all the same no matter where it comes from. The whole center of the store is going to go away or itâ€™s going to be filled with specialty goods. Thatâ€™s my hope. Grocery stores are going to shrink and become more specialty stores, and theyâ€™re going to sell better food. Is that, in some sense, a return to what it was like in the early days of the grocery store? Thatâ€™s exactly what itâ€™s returning to  â€”   when a small grocery would sell a variety of very special   goods. This interview has been edited for length and clarity."
156844,4,primary,25,"As Doug Andreassen, the chairman of US Soccerâ€™s diversity task force, looks across the game he loves, all he can see is a system broken in America. And he wonders why nobody seems to care. He sees    families spending thousands of dollars a year on soccer clubs that propel their children to the sportâ€™s highest levels, while thousands of gifted athletes in mostly African American and Latino neighborhoods get left behind. He worries about this inequity. Soccer is the worldâ€™s great democratic game, whose best stars have come from the worldâ€™s slums, ghettos and favelas. And yet in the US the path to the top is often determined by how many zeroes a parent can write in their checkbook. Andreassen watches his federationâ€™s national teams play, and wishes they had more diversity. Like many, he canâ€™t ignore the fact that last yearâ€™s Womenâ€™s World Cup winners were almost all white, or that several of the   players on the US Copa America roster grew up overseas. The talents of some of Americaâ€™s best young players are being suffocated by a process that never lets them be seen. He sighs. â€œPeople donâ€™t want to talk about it,â€ he says. Andreassen used to dance gingerly around the topic, using the same careful code words as the other coaches and heads of leagues, trying not to push or offend only to find that little changed. He has stopped being political. He is frustrated. He is passionate. He is blunt. â€œThe system is not working for the underserved community,â€ he says. â€œItâ€™s working for the white kids. â€ But why? How come soccer canâ€™t be more like basketball in America? How come athletes from the countryâ€™s huge urban areas arenâ€™t embracing a sport that requires nothing but a ball to play? How have our national soccer teams not found a way to exploit what should be a huge pool of talent? â€œWe used to say to ourselves: â€˜How good would we be if we could just get the kids in the cities,â€™â€ one former US official says. And yet a quarter of a century into soccerâ€™s American boom, that hasnâ€™t happened. Coaches, organizers and advocates say interest is there, especially among immigrants from Mexico and Central and South America, where devotion to soccer runs generations in families. But finding those kids is hard. Money has only hardened the divide between rich and poor, leaving the game to thrive in wealthy communities, where the cost of organized soccer has become outrageous, pricing out those in lower income neighborhoods. â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s systematic racism,â€ says Nick Lusson, the director of NorCal Premier Soccer Foundation an organization to grow soccer in Californiaâ€™s underserved communities. â€œItâ€™s just a system that has been built with blinders to equality. â€ Three years ago, Roger Bennett of Men in Blazers and Greg Kaplan, a University of Chicago economics professor, set out to study the effects of the    system on American soccer. They compared the background of each US menâ€™s national team member from 1993 to 2013 to that of every NBA all star and NFL pro bowler over the same period, using   data from their hometown zip codes. They found the soccer players came from communities that had higher incomes, education and employment rankings, and were whiter than the US average, while the basketball and football players came from places that ranked lower than average on those same indicators. Those numbers have tightened since 2008, reflecting more recent diversity in soccer, but the gap remains. â€œIâ€™m  â€”   to be honest  â€”   surprised that the data is so striking,â€ Kaplan says. There are a lot of reasons for this disparity, but mostly everything comes down to perception and economics. â€œIt continues to be seen as a white, suburban sportâ€ says Briana Scurry, who won the Womenâ€™s World Cup in 1999 with the US, and was arguably the countryâ€™s most prominent black female player. As a child growing up in Minneapolis, Scurry loved basketball. She assumes it would have been the game she chose to play in college. That changed when her family moved to the suburbs when she was in grade school, and a teacher handed out flyers for a local soccer league. There had been no such activities in her former home. The idea city kids would play suburban soccer was too ludicrous to consider. People do want to change the    system. US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati says he believes the organization â€œhas made a lot of stridesâ€ before adding: â€œWe have a long ways to go. â€ Andreassen believes Gulati is committed to the issue, as are a handful of others. But in a world where soccer coaches in wealthy communities can earn decent livings, there are few, like Lusson, who gave up what he calls a â€œcushy jobâ€ running a league in the pricey East Bay suburbs of San Francisco to direct a program in the underserved community of Hayward. â€œYou are buying skill,â€ Scurry says of those parents who can spend on their childrenâ€™s soccer. â€œBut there are some pieces of the game that just canâ€™t be bought. â€ Sometimes on weekends Julio Borge, who is director of coaching at the mostly Latino Heritage Soccer Club in Pleasant Hill, California, will spend the day watching games in the ligas Latinas around San Franciscoâ€™s East Bay. Most of the areaâ€™s   population knows nothing about these games that are played at local parks in neighborhoods filled with immigrants from Central and South America. But to the families who gather on the fields to barbecue, listen to music and watch soccer, they are the highlight of the week. â€œThe soccer is amazing quality,â€ says Borge, who will sometimes try to recruit players from the ligas Latinas for his teams. But with a cost of $1, 395 a year, which he uses to cover coaches, fields, insurance and officials, he knows most wonâ€™t afford to play on his team. He can occasionally offer a scholarship to a player if someone donates the money to do so, but there is never enough for the children whose families hover above the poverty level. â€œIn my area, we are missing a ton of these kids,â€ he says. â€œA lot of coaches donâ€™t have time to see everybody. Itâ€™s expensive to try out for the big programs, so many donâ€™t even go after the opportunity. â€ The cost of youth soccer these days is outrageous. Borgeâ€™s $1, 395 team is a bargain compared to many travel programs where the base fee is $3, 000 a year. â€œHow can you charge that for just a year?â€ Scurry asks. â€œThatâ€™s ridiculous. â€ And yet two of her friends are paying more than that for their kids in the Virginia suburbs of Washington DC. Across the Potomac River, in Maryland, parents can pay up to $12, 000 a year on soccer after adding the cost of travel to    tournaments. Most of these teams offer scholarships to kids with financial needs. The gift is kind and usually   but they come with their own problems. Usually they go to the very best players in the poor neighborhoods, and they come with the implication that the scholarship kid is expected to help their new team win. They also displace children in the lineup whose parents are paying full price, and wonder why they are spending thousands a year to have their child sit on the bench. Scholarships often cover the cost of the league but little else. They donâ€™t provide transportation for the player whose parents might work during practice, or donâ€™t have enough money for gas to drive to games. Some families donâ€™t have email and canâ€™t get the club announcements. Resentment builds. â€œThe parents will say to scholarship kids  â€”   and I have seen this countless times  â€”   â€˜Why did you miss the game on Saturday? We are paying for you to be here,â€™â€ Lusson says. â€œWhat does a kid say to that? Or what happens if they are late to practice? Or who is going to pay for them to travel to that tournament in San Diego? Thatâ€™s like the moon to some of these kids. We have kids here in the East Bay who have never seen the beach. â€œThey drop out of the program and then what happens?â€ he continues. â€œThey have burned the bridge back to their old club by leaving, and arenâ€™t welcome back. They drop out and drift away and we lose them and thatâ€™s terrible because they were really, really talented. â€ Economics work against the poor kids in American soccer. Lusson sees this every week as he moves between the teenage girls team he coaches in the wealthy San Francisco enclave of Pacific Heights, and the teams he manages in   Hayward. One night, a few weeks ago, he listened as girls on the Pacific Heights team talked excitedly about applications to elite east coast colleges. The next day, in Hayward, nobody talked about college. And yet he is amazed by the skill of his Hayward players, who he says would crush the Pacific Heights team in a match. These are the players who could be the future of American soccer, perhaps even rising as high as a national team. But he also knows that the Pacific Heights players will be the ones to play on their college teams and will be identified by US Soccer. They are the ones who will get a chance that the Hayward kids wonâ€™t. And this strikes Lusson as very wrong. The other day, he went to watch a match between a team made up of mostly   San   college players against a group of players from poorer neighborhoods in the East Bay and Fresno three hours away. For a few minutes, the college players controlled the game until their untrained opponents deciphered their system, and then ripped it apart by  . In the second half, the East   team trampled the San Francisco team. â€œIâ€™ve been seeing that game my whole playing career,â€ Lusson says. For a time, just out of college, he played professionally in Brazil. It feels rigid in the organized levels here, drained of any life. The difference is as simple as Brazilian children dribbling balls on the streets as they walk to school while American kids lug balls in bags, only pulling them out once they reach the field for a practice or game. â€œWe are delivering a lot of people who do soccer but not play soccer,â€ he continues. â€œI think sometimes we have to be courageous with ourselves and admit when we have a problem. â€ One of the biggest complaints about the    system is that the   in suburban programs strips kids of the creativity that comes from playing on the streets. Borge loves his recruiting trips to the underground leagues where kids are free from restrictions. Too often, when a skilled and imaginative player leaves their neighborhood team to join a bigger team in a wealthier community, their gifts are considered a hindrance. The clever dancing with the ball that makes them unique earns them the label of not being a team player. A message is delivered: conform or leave"
156844,5,tertiary,154,"Those who deal in diversity in American soccer know this is a problem. They talk about it all the time. â€œWe are making these little robots,â€ Lusson says. No one seems sure what to do. How do you tell players to be imaginative while at the same time fitting into the more rigid needs laid out by American coaches? No one knows. â€œI donâ€™t know how to structure unstructured,â€ Gulati says with a chuckle. â€œI donâ€™t know how else to say it. â€ But coaches like Borge are looking for the answer to come from US Soccer. Borgeâ€™s voice rises as he begins to talk about the fractured network of leagues around the country, with coaches imposing their own unyielding vision of how soccer should be played. He wants someone in the federation to devise a strategy, not just for a style of play, but for getting the best players to the top. â€œWe need someone to speak up  â€”   [JÃ¼rgen] Klinsmann or whatever  â€”   and say: â€˜Here are the players we are looking for, and hereâ€™s how the system should be built,â€™â€ Borge says. â€œWe have coaches who need to recruit talent from all over the nation and invest in the ODP and let them be creative and let the let them play freely. It takes huge dedication and it takes money but we have the money at US Soccer. â€ â€œYou want to know about diversity in soccer?â€ Andreassen asks. â€œHereâ€™s a story about diversity in soccer. â€ A few years ago, when Andreassen was head of Washington Youth Soccer, a    girl from a   community south of Seattle showed up in the townâ€™s league. Her family was from Mexico, and she had grown up with several older brothers who loved soccer and had developed tremendous skill playing with them. The league organizers wanted her to go to an Olympic Development Program tournament in Arizona that is scouted by college coaches, and because her family had little money, a sponsor was found to pay for the trip. The girl played brilliantly at the tournament. She was surrounded by college coaches who flooded her with offers, which is unheard of for a sophomore in high school playing at an ODP tournament. But when she returned home her father banned her from playing soccer. He was undocumented, and he feared that if she became a college player, someone would notify the government and he would be deported. They never saw her again. The story stayed with Andreassen. It was yet another window into a gap that had been bothering him for years. How many cultural chasms between his white world and the invisible one  â€”   to him  â€”   around it existed? He wondered what would have happened if she had gotten hurt at the ODP tournament. One of his other great passions is the prevention of head trauma in soccer. What if she had gotten a concussion? Who would have taken care of her? Her family probably didnâ€™t have health insurance. Who would handle the hospital bills? Things that are taken for granted in   and   neighborhoods donâ€™t exist in the poor communities, opening the divide even more. When he took over as head of US Soccerâ€™s diversity committee, he asked these questions on the quarterly conference calls he had with the other members. He pulled together lists of the things that didnâ€™t work and tried to find solutions. â€œThere are the kids in the diverse communities playing on the street corner, and we have to find them,â€ he says. â€œSomeone knows they are there, either the church or the school. Maybe itâ€™s a pastor or a principal or someone at the YMCA or Boyâ€™s and Girlâ€™s Club. We have to identify those community leaders. â€ Andreassen really likes the Urban Soccer Leadership Academy, a program in San Antonio run by former mayor Ed Garza. Garza is using soccer in building teams similar to those in the suburbs  â€”   but at a minimal cost. Garza chose soccer as the foundation for his program because sports like football and basketball already had a strong infrastructure in San Antonio and there was no organization that held together the cityâ€™s immigrant families. He saw so much skill going to waste. â€œOur city teams were beating the suburban teams,â€ Garza says. â€œWhat if our inner city had a program to develop soccer players? Can you imagine how much better they would become, on a skill level, and get the attention of pro and college scouts?â€ The program, which is designed to help send as many kids to college as possible, has recently expanded from largely Latino neighborhoods to include African American communities as well. But what impresses Andreassen the most is it gives hope to the kids who would otherwise be lost in the    system the structure of a suburban team without losing their identity or style of play. He and his task force have written a proposal that has been delivered to US Soccer. He wants to create a national leadership academy to give leaders in underserved neighborhoods the power to build their own San Antonios. The academy would be based in a central location, with the hope to eventually build more around the country and it would exist to show those local principals and pastors and coaches how to make a league that operates like the suburban associations. They would be taught about fundraising and tax filings and field rental"
156844,6,primary,393,"But what they would get most is admission to the same world as the wealthy suburban clubs. Once underground leagues now would be on the map, in view of college coaches and federation and professional scouts. The kids playing on the street corner would have a greater possibility of being found. They would get a chance. Gulati has read Andreassenâ€™s proposal but he sees a lot of proposals and a lot of ideas. The    model isnâ€™t unique to the US, he says. It exists in more traditional soccer countries. What seems to discourage him is the extreme cost of the American system, as well as the fact that the federation has not been able to identify as many players in   neighborhoods as he would like. â€œItâ€™s an important priority,â€ he says. â€œLook, we are in some ways still a developing foundation. â€ In 10 or 15 years, Gulati hopes the USâ€™s top teams will be more diverse, and that many of the walls that divide the rich and poor in soccer will have come down. He sees great promise in the growth of the MLS where teams like the Philadelphia Union are not only investing in youth development academies but building their own academy facilities as well. He is certain that the more soccer blossoms in the US, and the professional leagues establish themselves, kids who feel left out in todayâ€™s model will see a path for themselves in the game. Like everyone else, Gulati notices the racial makeup of the womenâ€™s national team, but he says the federation is working hard to build the game at the grassroots level. Someday he would love to see the sport grow to such a robust level in underserved neighborhoods that there will be a deep pool of talent that everyone knows about, and that some of those players will rise to the national team. â€œEverybody wants to do better,â€ Gulati says about diversity. There are signs of improvement. More coaches like Lusson are leaving wealthy suburban programs to help run teams in poorer areas. More programs like Garzaâ€™s in San Antonio are starting to grow. And funds are trickling into the neighborhoods that need them. The US Soccer Foundation (unrelated to the federation) has built several futsal courts in inner cities in an effort to recreate the free play of so many Central and South American children. It has also served 71, 000 mostly African American and Latino kids in its Soccer For Success program that provides coaching and mentoring for children in   neighborhoods. The program operates between the 3pm and 6pm, when school ends and parents are less likely to be home. â€œEverybody understands the issue,â€ says the foundationâ€™s president and CEO Ed  . â€œTalk about a family living on $25, 000 with four kids in a place like Washington DC or even double that, $40, 000 in Washington DC. Those kids shouldnâ€™t be barred [from soccer] because their parents donâ€™t make much money. â€ And yet how fast will change come? Yes, more than a third of the menâ€™s roster in this monthâ€™s Copa AmÃ©rica are  . But a good number of those learned their soccer overseas, because Klinsmann appears to feel the creativity is still lacking in American soccer. The womenâ€™s team going to the Rio Olympics, meanwhile, will almost certainly have a similar racial makeup as the one that played in last summerâ€™s World Cup. â€œI donâ€™t see why our team has fewer [black players] than England or France,â€ Scurry says. â€œThe systems are different here and the people who have the access are the people who have the money. â€ Families are still paying thousands of dollars for soccer teams that travel to faraway tournaments, which are often the only places college coaches go to watch players because their recruiting budgets are small. The poorest kids are still shut out. The game is not coming to them in flyers at school the way it did for Scurry in suburban Minneapolis so many years ago. Lusson says   parents driving their scholarship kids into wealthy neighborhoods are still getting pulled over by the police who wonder why they are there. Even MLS teams are motivated by money in opening their academies. Speaking privately, one executive says his team only takes players they believe they can monetize, either by developing for the team itself or selling that player to another club. This limits their reach because they rarely take chances on a borderline prospect, leaving a soup of expensive youth travel and elite soccer clubs to find and train that player. More than likely the system will not allow that to happen. â€œIâ€™ve been doing this since 2002, and I donâ€™t see anything that says this will change,â€ Borge says. On the phone, Andreassen, who can talk long and fast, is suddenly quiet. He is sure Gulati shares his passion, but he wonders if many others do. â€œI think Iâ€™ve pushed the ball one revolution,â€ he says. â€œBut my goal is to get it down to the goalline. â€ Sometimes he wonders if anyone notices. Is anybody listening? Does anybody care?"

But when I turned my phone back on upon arrival, I noticed something very odd, something that had in fact never happened before. A post had been deleted from my Facebook page without any warning. I had shared one of the most iconic images from the Vietnam war  â€”   Nick Utâ€™s photograph of a naked, screaming child running away from napalm bombs, as a statement in the ongoing debate about Facebookâ€™s editing policies. Facebook has taken a strong, rigid stance against â€œindecentâ€ images. And it is commendable that they execute their role in the prevention of the distribution of images containing violence and child abuse seriously. We all have a responsibility towards this. Yet, by failing to distinguish between such images, and others that have formed the fabric of our history as a global society, Facebook neglects another important role that it plays on the world stage. To erase posts containing such images is to limit freedom of expression, democracy, the right to criticize and question, and view past events as they actually were, not as they have been deemed to be by one giant corporation. I am happy to note that Facebook has now decided to reverse that policy in this particular case  â€”   but serious questions remain"
152274,8,secondary,311,"Media consumption today is increasingly digitized, but even more so it is curated. News and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Flipboard have overtaken traditional news outlets as our primary sources of information, of news, of connection to the world around us. They have become our most frequently visited sites, especially among the younger generations, and have empowered the public to create and share their own content. With this ease of access to information in todayâ€™s world, comes a great responsibility to enact policies that make positive contributions to society. By exercising such overarching editorial rights, large corporations that ought to bring us closer together as human beings through transparency, end up altering history, and altering the truth. Already, Facebook and other media outletsâ€™ algorithms narrow the range of content one sees based on past preferences and interests. This limits the kind of stories one sees, and in turn restricts access to a holistic outlook for the user. We run the risk of creating parallel societies in which some people are not aware of the real issues facing the world, and this is only exacerbated by such editorial oversight. As we move towards a more automated world, this is not a responsibility that should be surrendered to machines only. By deleting such iconic pictures that have played a crucial role in transforming world views on the pain and cruelty of war, Facebook is contributing to changing history. I want my children, and other children around the world, to grow up in a society where history is told as it was. In a society where they can grow into mature adults by learning from experiences of past generations, to be better informed citizens of the world. They need to understand what happened both in our darkest moments and our brightest. Today, images are the most powerful and important means of communication, and they must depict reality. It would be tragic for history, for the truth, to be told in the version that comes from any one corporationâ€™s mouthpiece. This is why I believe it is imperative that such outlets take their responsibility seriously, while exercising such great influence over their usersâ€™ access to information. We have today shown that through the power of social media, we can influence social media. Letâ€™s continue to do that. It is after all a platform for and made by the people, where you canâ€™t let machines run your morality."
165221,9,secondary,71,"RenÃ©e Fleming and Francis Collins have something unexpected in common: music. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, plays guitar. Fleming, of course, is a renowned soprano. She is also an Artistic Advisor at Large to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D. C. and the two of them are joining forces this weekend for a program called Sound Health. The   event will explore connections between music, health, wellness and science through musical performances and presentations from neuroscientists. All Things Considered host Robert Siegel spoke with Fleming and Collins about their work together and what they hope to convey to the public about the intersection between art and science. They also sang a duet. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. On how their collaboration on music and the brain came about, Fleming: We met unexpectedly at quite an extraordinary dinner party. Collins: It was two years ago. It was on a Saturday night. It happened to be the Saturday night after the Supreme Court had issued their final decisions for 2015, and three of the Supreme Court justices were present. So, having a little unwinding going on there, because they had been on different sides. We had Anthony Kennedy, we had Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and we had Antonin Scalia, all gathering to have a wonderful dinner and a little music, which was provided by a sort of ok band  â€”   which, somehow, I think we took over. Fleming: We had an interesting conversation that night at dinner, because I said â€Do you think that we could collaborate with these two institutions? Put something together to amplify the work being done in this field?â€ and he didnâ€™t hesitate. On research showing humans may have sung before they spoke, Collins: I think itâ€™s increasingly becoming clear that must be the case. One of the really exciting findings that has recently come forward as we have better means of imaging the brain, [is] that if you put somebody in an MRI scanner and you look to see which part of the brain is getting activated when you hear a voice or when you hear a musical sound, theyâ€™re different. Your brain has a music room, and evolution would not have gone to the trouble of designing that if it didnâ€™t have some benefits. So, that suggests to me that we and our ancestors have had music as a central part of our experience for eons. And weâ€™re just beginning to understand how that might be. I think thatâ€™s fascinating. On whether Fleming thinks about her brain while sheâ€™s singing, Fleming: The brain has to support me in my singing, no question. Having to memorize in foreign languages that I donâ€™t even speak is an arduous task. I participated in a study at the NIH. I was in an fMRI machine for two hours, singing this tune, [The Water is Wide] imagining it and speaking it. Itâ€™s not an attractive sound, especially because Iâ€™m competing with the sound of the machine, but itâ€™s incredible to see the pictures  â€”   how it looks with the revolving brain and all the parts that are activated in this fMRI under those three different circumstances. Itâ€™s all quite different. On the opportunities presented by advances in brain imaging, Collins: For me itâ€™s both a basic science opportunity, to use what weâ€™re learning about how music affects the brain to understand the brain better, but itâ€™s also got this therapeutic implication. Music therapy can be incredibly powerful for kids with autism, adults with Alzheimerâ€™s and everything in between, but we donâ€™t really understand most of the time how it works. We can give this field a stronger scientific base, and it can be even better. On future funding for research in the field of music and neuroscience, Collins: Weâ€™re just bold enough to think that we might be able to figure out how the circuits in the brain do what they do, and use that information to help people with many different disorders that affect the brain, including mental illness, including epilepsy, including traumatic brain injury. Music is part of that need for understanding. So, even though weâ€™ve never been in a position where I would say we have enough resources, we would certainly want to prioritize this effort."
183159,10,primary,949," The U. N. Security Council on Friday expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the United States and Pyongyangâ€™s only major ally China since President Donald Trump took office. The Trump administration has been pressing China aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor, warning that all options are on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development programs. The United States has struggled to slow those programs, which have become a security priority given Pyongyangâ€™s vow to develop a   missile capable of hitting the U. S. mainland. â€The United States will continue to seek a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to this situation,â€ U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council after the vote. But she added: â€Beyond diplomatic and financial consequences, the United States remains prepared to counteract North Korean aggression through other means, if necessary.â€ Adding names to the U. N. blacklist   a global travel ban and asset freeze   was the minimum sanctions measures the Security Council could have taken and comes after five weeks of negotiations between Washington and Beijing. â€The Security Council is sending a clear message to North Korea today   stop firing ballistic missiles or face the consequences,â€ Haley said. The resolution, adopted unanimously by the   council, sanctions four entities, including the Koryo Bank and Strategic Rocket Force of the Korean Peopleâ€™s Army, and 14 people, including the head of Pyongyangâ€™s overseas spying operations"
183159,11,secondary,590,"North Koreaâ€™s Koryo Bank handles overseas transactions for Office 38, a shadowy body that manages the private slush funds of the North Korean leadership, according to a South Korean government database. â€™CRITICAL WINDOWâ€™ The measures adopted on Friday could have been agreed by the councilâ€™s North Korea sanctions committee behind closed doors, but Washington convinced China to back a public vote on the blacklist, amplifying the councilâ€™s unhappiness with Pyongyangâ€™s defiance of a U. N. ban on ballistic missile launches. The U. N. Security Council first imposed sanctions on Pyongyang in 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear tests and two   missile launches. North Korea is threatening a sixth nuclear test. â€There is a critical window of opportunity for the nuclear issue of the peninsula to come back to the right track of seeking a settlement through dialogue and negotiations,â€ Chinese U. N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told the council. â€It is incumbent on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and to do more to help ease the tension and build mutual trust.â€ He again proposed a simultaneous freeze of North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs and South Korea and the United Statesâ€™ joint military exercises. Russia said the suggestion merits â€serious consideration.â€ Haley said: â€We want a negotiated solution, but North Korea must fulfill its basic obligations by first stopping all ballistic missile launches and nuclear weapons testing and taking concrete steps toward getting rid of its nuclear weapons program.â€ U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Security Council on April 28 that it needed to act before North Korea does. Just hours after the meeting   chaired by Tillerson during his first visit to the United Nations as the top U. S. diplomat   Pyongyang launched yet another ballistic missile. â€™UNFRIENDLY STEPSâ€™ Within days the United States proposed to China that the Security Council strengthen sanctions on North Korea over its repeated missile launches. Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions before involving the other council members. Pyongyang has launched several more ballistic missiles since then, including a   missile on Monday that landed in the sea off its east coast. Diplomats said it appeared China was still only likely to consider additional strong new U. N. sanctions measures, such as an oil embargo, a ban on Pyongyangâ€™s airline or tougher economic sanctions, if North Korea conducted a   missile launch or another nuclear test. The last round of complex sanctions imposed by the Security Council took three months to negotiate following Pyongyangâ€™s fifth nuclear test in September. Those measures aimed to cut North Koreaâ€™s annual export revenue by a quarter. China has also been infuriated by the U. S. deployment of an advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)   system in South Korea, saying it was a threat to its security and would do nothing to ease tension with Pyongyang. Security Council veto power Russia backed the U. N. measures on Friday. Moscowâ€™s support had been unclear after the United States imposed its own sanctions on Thursday on Russian firms for their support of North Koreaâ€™s weapons programs. â€This step is something that is very puzzling and deeply disappointing,â€ Deputy Russian U.

170404,14,secondary,505,"So you think that beer you brewed in your kitchen is ready for prime time, and youâ€™re thinking, â€Maybe I should take the plunge and set up a little craft brewery.â€ Youâ€™re not the only one with dreams infused with hops and malting barley. During the past couple of years, new breweries were being launched at the rate of three a day in the U. S. New District Brewing is one of them. It just popped up in a   building in an Arlington, Va"
170404,15,secondary,590," park. On this particular evening,   Mike Katrivanos is behind the sleek tasting room bar, where eight NDB originals are on tap. He makes sure all his patrons know that heâ€™s a â€localâ€  â€”   his grandmother lived just a couple of blocks from here. Local is a big deal in craft brewing. â€Folks, when they come to a brewery, they want to meet the brewers,â€ Katrivanos says. â€And they want to connect with what theyâ€™re drinking.â€ Another big thing is, of course, flavor. Regulars Don Ripper and his friend Chana Morrow, who show up about once a week, are here for a tasting this evening. â€Really good balance,â€ Ripper says as he sips a golden IPA called Folded Note. Morrow has a darker brew, called Origins Unknown. â€Nutty, malty,â€ she says, as she savors. A desire for beers that have more taste is, not surprisingly, a big part of whatâ€™s driving the demand for craft beer. Just ask New District regular James Miervaldis  â€”   he says he loves the variety here and â€how they experiment.â€ Does he ever drink Bud or Miller? â€Oh, God no  â€”   never, never, never.â€ So, fueled by the unquenchable thirst of its customers for the next great flavor note, the craft beer industry has exploded like a poorly fermented bottle of home brew. Now 1 in every 8 beers sold in the U. S. is craft beer, and more than 20 percent of the money consumers spend on beer goes to independent and small brewers. Flying Dog Brewery in Frederick, Md. was founded in the 1990s. But CEO Jim Caruso says thereâ€™s been an even bigger boom since 2008, with a growth rate thatâ€™s pushed the number of craft breweries to more than 4, 000. Meanwhile, Caruso says, beer titans like Budweiser, Miller and Coors have seen sales trend down. So the giant brewers have taken action"
170404,16,primary,46," has bought up a number of craft breweries, including Seattleâ€™s Elysian Brewing and Chicagoâ€™s Goose Island, and Constellation Brands just paid $1 billion for Ballast Point, a San Diego craft brewer. These developments, Caruso says, are persuading some people to start brewing because itâ€™s the next â€get rich quickâ€ scheme. And thatâ€™s led to some newcomers â€putting out some bad beer,â€ he says. He worries that if consumers get a few bottles of beer thatâ€™s not good, they may get turned off the industry. â€It may be months or years before they come back and try it again,â€ he says. But say youâ€™re confident in your brewing skills: Is there still time for you to get into the business? Probably, says Bart Watson, an economist for the Brewers Association. New brewery openings outnumber closings nearly 10 to 1, Watson says. And the industry, which adds around $55 billion a year to the U. S. economy, now helps support 424, 000 jobs. But some parts of the country have become pretty crowded  â€”   perhaps overcrowded  â€”   with new breweries, Watson says. San Diego County, Calif. has more than 110 breweries, and Portland, Ore. has 60, just in the city proper. â€Those places are really pushing the limit,â€ he says. The craft beer movement largely started in the West, Watson notes, and is now moving eastward. Thatâ€™s partly because state regulation of alcohol was strongest in the East after Prohibition and has been loosened more slowly. So, Watson says, in the East and the Southeast, thereâ€™s lots more room for craft beer to grow. And Watson offers another statistic that should ease concerns about a brewery bubble forming: There are about 8, 000 wineries in the United States, and, he says, â€Americans drink a lot more beer than they drink wine.â€ So, he says, as long as many of them are small, and locally focused  â€”   â€like a local restaurantâ€  â€”   he thinks there are plenty of opportunities and market niches where small brewers can thrive. So go ahead, start your own brewery. Just expect to come up with an initial investment of around $500, 000, and donâ€™t expect to get rich, says New Districtâ€™s Katrivanos. He is hanging on to his engineering job at the Pentagon until his brewery can pay him a salary. â€If youâ€™re getting into brewing specifically to make money, Iâ€™d advise against it,â€ he says. If thatâ€™s your goal, he says, â€You should go start a tech company.â€"
211502,17,primary,118," As Deflategate wore on, the lawyers representing Tom Brady forgot to do something essential. They forgot to argue their clientâ€™s innocence. Instead Jeffrey Kessler and the NFL Players Association got so lost in pushing their interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and trying to trim the powers of Commissioner Roger Goodell that they failed to drive home the essential point: How can a player be suspended for â€œconduct detrimentalâ€ when there was no conduct to begin with?  To date, we are still looking for a single shred of credible evidence that any human hand deflated the footballs in that AFC championship game. Where is the conduct? Much less the conduct detrimental? Somehow this point was missed in the many briefs and oral arguments. Consequently, three judges of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit missed it, too, ruling   in favor of the NFL and reinstating Bradyâ€™s   suspension. Even chief judge Robert A. Katzmann, whose   dissent left Brady some faint hope, missed it. Katzmann believes Goodell indeed invented â€œhis own brand of industrial justice,â€ and if the chief justice thinks so, then perhaps a full 2nd Circuit panel will too, should Brady seek a stay and appeal. If he does, this time around his lawyers should emphasize the only truly salient point of the entire case. As New York Law School professor Robert Blecker put it, â€œWhat happened to the deflate part of Deflategate?â€   [U. S. Court of Appeals rules in favor of Goodell in Brady case]  Regardless of whether Brady appeals, he and every other NFL player should now be on notice that their personal interests donâ€™t necessarily overlap with the NFLPA and its lawyers.

Aâ€ will determine the future of a major clothing manufacturing plant in California, one of the most expensive U. S. states in terms of labor costs. Keeping jobs in the United States has become a hot button political issue since the presidential election. Ford Motor Co on Tuesday reversed plans for a $1. 6 billion factory in Mexico and said it would add 700 jobs in Michigan after receiving criticism from   Donald Trump. See graphic here: ( ) Amazon and Forever 21, as well as   apparel maker Next Level Apparel and brand licensor Authentic Brands Group LLC, are in talks with American Apparel and its financial advisers about submitting offers ahead of a deadline on Friday, the people said. Any successful offer would have to top a $66 million stalking horse bid by Canadian apparel maker Gildan Activewear Inc, which American Apparel agreed to when it filed for bankruptcy in November. Gildanâ€™s offer included an option to keep American Apparelâ€™s manufacturing plants in southern California, which employ about 3, 500 workers, making American Apparel one of the biggest garment makers in the United States. But Gildan plans to preserve only some of the California production should its bid prevail, the sources said. Many of Gildanâ€™s production facilities are in   countries. An outcome in the auction is expected next week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. American Apparel declined to comment. Amazon, Forever 21, Next Level Apparel and Authentic Brands did not respond to requests for comment. A Gildan spokesman said in an email on Wednesday that it is putting together all the necessary information from its due diligence to best position itself in the auction. Amazonâ€™s acquisition of American Apparel would be a major push for the   company into branded fashion and apparel. The   company began to launch private label brands last year. Forever 21, founded by   Do Won Chang, is known for its low retail prices, helped by lower labor costs abroad.

Former Chief Executive Dov Charney founded the company in the late 1990s, when most   was moving offshore. For years this contrarian strategy worked. American Apparelâ€™s â€ â€ label was a hit with young people, helping make the brand a part of popular culture. Part of American Apparelâ€™s name recognition also stemmed from Charney himself, who was outspoken on immigration and fair wage issues, but was plagued by sexual harassment claims, which he has denied. The company was also famous for its sexually charged advertising. A 2009   with Immigration and Customs Enforcement over the legal employment status of 1, 800 employees sent American Apparel on a downward trajectory, according to court documents from the companyâ€™s 2015 bankruptcy. American Apparel had to fire these employees, more than a quarter of its manufacturing workforce. The layoffs caused production delays and a 90 percent    drop in profits in 2009, according to the documents. Charney was ousted in 2014, and the companyâ€™s finances deteriorated further, plus it struggled with an unsustainable debt load. It filed for bankruptcy in October 2015, and emerged in February 2016, only to seek bankruptcy protection once again in November 2016. American Apparel has notified its workers that they could be losing their jobs as early as this month. Gildan makes most of its garments offshore, with close to 90 percent of its 42, 000 employees in   Caribbean and Central American countries.

And I think people like coming and either looking at people or being looked at.â€ Sheâ€™s right. So much looking, and so much picture taking. Madeleine Albright herself,   with Scandal star Kerry Washington. Celebrity DJ Steve Aoki   with comedian and Obama anger translator   Key. â€Itâ€™s pretty epic so far,â€ Aoki said. â€Itâ€™s overwhelming. This is not my world at all.â€ Thereâ€™s reality TV star and Trump supporter Omarosa Manigault taking a phone from MSNBC host Chris Matthews to help him take more photos. Will Smith walking the red carpet, taking a selfie with all the photographers there, while they took photos of him taking the selfie. Itâ€™s hard to tell who the politicos are and who the fans are and who the celebrities are when everyone wants to be in everybodyâ€™s picture. You could see this all as obscene excess  â€”   the establishment   congratulating itself while the rest of the country languishes in a populist funk. The very idea of â€nerd promâ€ suggests itâ€™s a party for people who shouldnâ€™t really even be having a party. WHCD could be D. C. at its worst, or depending on how you look at it, D. C. at its best. For Katie Caperones, a D. C. local who came to the lobby of the Hilton last night to people watch, it all made sense. â€Because politics and Hollywood are almost the same thing now,â€ she told NPR. â€The way that politics gets covered is like how Hollywood gets covered.â€ But it wasnâ€™t all fun and games. At the same time, just outside the Hilton, a few dozen protesters gathered to raise awareness of the plight of civilians in Syria, as that countryâ€™s civil war continues. â€Weâ€™re here today because in the past 48 hours more than two hospitals [in Syria] were bombed directly by aerial attacks,â€ Mouaz Moustafa said, as police officers and yellow caution tape kept him away from the celebration. â€The United Statesâ€™ policy remains silent about the deaths of many, many civilians. .. We are here to make everyone thatâ€™s having a good time listen, and to remember that while we sit here and we dine and we joke, people and children are dying everyday.â€ Such is nerd prom in Washington DC. An exercise in extremes. Protesters next to a party"
168860,34,tertiary,510," nerds next to celebrities. So much excess, it makes sense to have so many events. Even though they werenâ€™t stars at the official dinner, Arianna Huffington,   of The Huffington Post, parading   producer DJ Khaled through the throngs,    while a servant of some sort held an umbrella over her head, could have been the nightâ€™s best celebrity coupling. â€He was the biggest star in the room,â€ Huffington said of her guest. â€Everybody wanted selfies with him, pictures with him. Amazing.â€ More amazing are all the people who sill celebrate WHCD even though they canâ€™t actually get in. Ball gowns are purchased and tuxedos are rented just to attend ancillary events like the Politico watch party just down the street, or perhaps the most popular event of the night, The Onionâ€™s â€Diamond Joe Bidenâ€™s Badass     Fiestaâ€ held at The Newseum. That event was in the spirit of The Onionâ€™s satirical depiction of the current Vice President, washing a Trans Am on the front lawn of the White House, or wearing a ponytail to the presidential inauguration. Attendees could take a picture with a shirtless Joe Biden cutout placed next to an empty pack of cigarettes and an unexplained pair of red panties, or walk through a fake Biden museum featuring his first marijuana joint. (NOTE: To be clear, the entire marijuana joint storyline was made up by The Onion.) Chad Nackers, head writer at The Onion, and one of the creators of â€Diamond Joe,â€ said the persona he made for the Vice President isnâ€™t true at all, and thatâ€™s why it works. â€Heâ€™s â€ he said. â€Heâ€™s totally  . He doesnâ€™t drink!â€ While a string quartet played 80â€™s rock hits, Nackers admitted that it is a bit ironic that one of the hottest tickets in town WHCD night would be put on by a fake news site, celebrating a caricature. When asked if it meant that The Onion was itself becoming establishment, he said, â€Hell no. I think itâ€™s great. I love it.â€ For personal finance guru Suze Orman, who held court at multiple parties through the night, the entire scene is good  â€”   a chance for Washington to be something approaching its truest, kindest self. â€I think people play their roles very well on television,â€ she said, in between snapping selfies with fans. â€I think when the TV comes off, everybody likes everybody,â€ commenting on the fact that at events like these you often see Republicans   with Democrats. â€And I think theyâ€™re all good people. .. When it comes down to it, theyâ€™re nothing but people trying to make a buck.â€ And for this crowd, part of making that buck is remaining famous, and being seen. Whether a Hollywood or D. C. celebrity, nights like WHCD might be a requirement for personal brand maintenance. And not just nights, but the days of   and   and   and reception. The entire   complex. Maybe itâ€™s not a party for all these people. Maybe itâ€™s just part of the job."
176276,35,tertiary,0," After months of Brexit uncertainty, the first faint outlines of a plan from Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday have given investors in Britainâ€™s pound something to work with at last   although substantial risks remain of the currency falling again. May confirmed what most Westminster watchers had come to expect, that Britain will pull out of the European Unionâ€™s single market when it exits the bloc and not look for a compromise deal to retain some of its benefits. But, perhaps sensing that a Supreme Court decision would force her hand anyway, she said that parliament would get a vote on the Brexit deal and that firms would be given time to make the transition to the new arrangements. Traders said the almost 3 percent rise in sterling against the dollar that followed   its biggest daily gain since at least 1998   looked mainly like a squeeze on those who had already made money in six often chaotic months rather than conviction that its fall may be coming to an end. Stefan Hofrichter, chief economist for giant German asset manager Allianz, said that in principle sterling at Tuesdayâ€™s levels around $1. 23 was significantly undervalued. But he remained reluctant to recommend buying it. â€It depends on the valuation measure but (it is) probably in the area of 20 percent (undervalued) which you could say is an argument to go long. But there are still a lot of uncertainties around it,â€ he said"
176276,36,tertiary,4,"â€For the time being we still donâ€™t know exactly what Brexit means.â€ DECLINING SHORTS Prior to Tuesdayâ€™s action, sterling had fallen 20 percent against the dollar and 14 percent against the euro since the Brexit vote last June. That decline has come in often violent stages. It gained almost 6 percent against the dollar from late October to early December but then fell all the way back in an unbroken succession of weekly declines. Investment bankers have grown more divided along the way. While many expect more weakness into the launch of Brexit talks in March, only 18 of the more than 50 economists and strategists polled by Reuters at the start of this month expected sterling to weaken to $1. 18 or less within the next six months. [FXPOLLS] The measures of positioning run by the U. S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission as well as the currency worldâ€™s big banking players all point to a large reduction in net bets against sterling from their peaks in   to late October. That could be read as an indication of improving sentiment. But it could also be seen as a sign that there is more space within the capital limits of big investors to bet heavily against the pound again. â€Despite the price move last week, clients have been slow to return to selling sterling,â€ said Richard Cochinos, head of European G10 FX Strategy at Citi, the worldâ€™s single biggest currency trader. â€Three out of Citiâ€™s four client types were net GBP buyers last week, with leveraged GBP net selling so small itâ€™s hardly worth mentioning. . .. Ample room exists on the positioning & flow side to rebuild shorts.â€ As companies factor sterlingâ€™s fall into their prices, inflation bounced back to 1. 6 percent in December, and it is expected to accelerate in the months ahead. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney hinted on Monday that there may be limits to how much price growth the bank can accept without responding with relatively tighter monetary policy, which would support the pound. Chancellor Philip Hammond, speaking at the same time as May, warned that currency volatility may dampen investors appetite for funding Britainâ€™s large public debt. â€Clients are taking their time building positions, there is no firm conviction at the moment. In the   they are reassessing the drivers of the trends now,â€ said Ned Rumpeltin, head of European FX strategy at TD Securities"

200185,38,secondary,130," Is Donald Trump really going to be the Republican presidential nominee?    After his victories this week, this   outcome looks more likely than ever, and Republican elites are increasingly resigning themselves to it. But he hasnâ€™t clinched it yet. Trump has built up such a lead in the delegate count at this point that heâ€™s all but assured to finish with more delegates than any of his rivals. By our count, he has around 990 delegates, which places him very far ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich:         Indeed, both Cruz and Kasich have been mathematically eliminated from getting enough delegates to win on the conventionâ€™s first ballot, under the partyâ€™s current rules"
200185,39,primary,62,"  So the main drama now is not over whether Trump will get the most delegates, itâ€™s about whether heâ€™ll win an outright majority of delegates  â€”   1, 237, the magic number he needs to clinch the GOP nomination on the first ballot"
200185,40,tertiary,39,"  Right now, Trump has about 990 delegates. So heâ€™s 247 or so away from the magic number, with 581 delegates still uncommitted or at stake in future primaries. The upshot is that Trump needs to win just 43 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch his majority"
200185,41,primary,303,"  But even if he falls a bit short of that majority, he now seems clearly on track to get very close to it. And the closer he gets, the more difficult it will be for the party to justify denying him the nomination. California and Indiana are the most important remaining states to watch The delegates that are still up for grabs fall into two main groups. There are about 500 delegates in the 10 states that havenâ€™t voted yet, and then there are about 80 delegates who are uncommitted and free to support whomever they choose. The next state to vote is Indiana on this coming Tuesday, May 3, with 57 delegates at stake. In my view, this is the second most important state remaining, because itâ€™s    (partly statewide, partly by congressional district) and has still seemed like it could tip to either Trump or Cruz. Most media commentators and politicos are interpreting Indiana as a   for Cruz at this point  â€”   if he loses it, his campaign will be deemed entirely dead rather than just mostly dead"
200185,42,tertiary,290,"  Four more states then vote in the remaining weeks of May. Of them, Nebraska is expected to give all its delegates to Cruz, West Virginia is expected to go strongly for Trump (though it has odd delegate allocation rules that could depress his total somewhat) and the candidates will split Oregon and Washingtonâ€™s delegates due to proportional allocation. All this leads up to the final day of GOP primary voting: June 7, when five states will vote"
200185,43,primary,61, New Jersey is a    state that Trump is expected to win easily
200185,44,tertiary,67,"South Dakota and Montana are also    states, and are expected to go to Cruz"
200185,45,tertiary,12,New Mexico is another proportional state where the delegates will be split
200185,46,primary,333,"But the dayâ€™s biggest prize, and the state that will likely determine whether Trump clinches his majority, is California. There are 172 delegates at stake there, and 159 of them will be allotted    on the congressional district level (three delegates in each of the stateâ€™s 53 districts)  â€”   which means that broad strength across the state will be necessary to pick up most of its delegates. If Trump doesnâ€™t manage to hit his magic number by June 7, however, heâ€™ll still have some time before the   convention. And in the interim, heâ€™ll work to win over those uncommitted delegates to try to get him over the top. (Theyâ€™re from various states and territories due to quirks in local rules, including North Dakota, Pennsylvania, American Samoa, and Guam.) Trump could also try to peel some unbound delegates who have endorsed Cruz away from him, perhaps arguing that the party should avert a divisive and damaging contested convention. According to a tally by PhD student Daniel Nichanian, Cruz has 24 of these delegates. (Trump has been endorsed by 30 or so unbound delegates that could in theory defect from him, too.) Convention shenanigans to block Trump are possible theoretically but a tough sell practically So, you may be wondering, is the Republican Party really stuck with Donald Trump as its nominee? Can they really do nothing to stop him?    In fact, the 2, 472 delegates who go to the convention have a great deal of power  â€”   so much so that they probably could prevent Trumpâ€™s nomination if they really, really wanted to. The problem is that this would badly flout the modern norm that a partyâ€™s voters determine the partyâ€™s presidential nominee, and would cause a tremendous backlash  â€”   a backlash for which the party doesnâ€™t appear to have an appetite. First of all, if Trump doesnâ€™t lock down that majority of delegates on the first ballot, then he doesnâ€™t become the nominee just yet. Multiple rounds of balloting will ensue, and more and more delegates will become freed up to vote for whomever they want. But what would happen after that isnâ€™t clear. Many have argued that since Trump has done a bad job of ensuring his supporters are installed as his delegates, party support would surely swing elsewhere as a second ballot. Yet polling shows that Republican voters think the candidate with the most delegates from primary voting should get the nomination. So itâ€™s possible that the delegates would be hesitant to defy what they perceive to be the public will to nominate the candidate who came in second or someone who didnâ€™t run at all"
200185,47,primary,316,"          Second, even if Trump does get an apparent delegate majority before the convention, there are various ways the delegates could, theoretically, change that. Most of these would involve changing the conventionâ€™s rules to tip the balance against Trump, which the delegates are perfectly free to do should they so desire  â€”   they have a lot of power! Yet the delegates will know full well that the more they actually use these powers to sway the outcome, the greater the backlash theyâ€™ll provoke. If current trends continue, Trump will have won the most delegates in primaries, the most votes, the most states. If GOP delegates change the rules at the last minute to block his nomination, it will (accurately) appear that they were trying to â€stealâ€ the election from Trump, and infuriate his many supporters"
200185,48,secondary,91,"  Recent evidence has pointed toward the party starting to resign itself to the inevitability of a Trump nomination, rather than gearing up for an intensely controversial effort to block him:   Single biggest thing Trump has going for him now is this attitude taking hold in the party: https:  "

182358,50,secondary,182,"The legislation, which now goes to the state House of Representatives, was spurred by the case of an emergency room physician charged last month under federal law with performing genital mutilation on two    girls at a suburban Detroit medical clinic. Another doctor and his wife who ran the clinic also have been charged in that case, believed to mark the first U. S. criminal prosecution of its kind. The three defendants could face prison terms of up to five years if convicted. Genital mutilation of girls, typically involving removal of all or part of the clitoris, is banned by several international treaties but remains a common cultural or religious practice in some African countries, including Somalia, Sudan and Egypt. State Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Rick Jones, a sponsor of the legislation, cited recent expert testimony before his panel describing Michigan as a â€hotspotâ€ for genital mutilation due to its large community of immigrants from countries where such surgery is still routinely performed. â€Itâ€™s been hidden. But now that weâ€™re aware, we want to make a very strong statement to the world   never again in Michigan,â€ he said. Aside from carrying tougher penalties than federal statute, Michiganâ€™s legislation would allow arrests and prosecution by local law enforcement"

Parents or guardians who bring children to Michigan from abroad or are found to have taken them overseas for such procedures could likewise be charged. The federal law, enacted in 1996, targets practitioners of female genital mutilation as well as individuals who carry a child across state lines to undergo the procedure. The package of four   Michigan bills cleared the state Senate unanimously, and Jones said he expects swift House passage and enactment by the governor in a matter of weeks. Jones said female genital mutilation bans have been passed or were under consideration in several other states, including Minnesota and Texas, but he believed Michiganâ€™s would be the toughest.

202889,53,secondary,151," Itâ€™s not your imagination, and youâ€™re not seeing double: There really are two movies out this weekend with the word â€infernoâ€ in the title"
202889,54,tertiary,258,"  One of them, Inferno, is the third film in the Da Vinci Code series, based on the novel by Dan Brown, directed by Ron Howard, and starring Tom Hanks. The other, Into the Inferno, is a documentary thatâ€™s (sort of) about volcanoes, directed by Werner Herzog. Itâ€™s hard to imagine two more different films. Inferno is twisty and ludicrous, a   romp through absurdity against the background of   Florence; Into the Inferno is a loose, sometimes funny, sometimes unsettling meditation on the ways raw natural power shapes human societies, imaginations, and beliefs. In other words, itâ€™s a Werner Herzog movie. What the two films have in common is also what separates them: Both sense that religion is a way of interpreting the world, but they approach their responsibility to that topic from opposite poles"
202889,55,tertiary,154,"   Inferno never really wanted to make sense      Rating  2     Inferno is actually based on Dan Brownâ€™s fourth novel about Harvard â€symbologistâ€ Robert Langdon  â€”   Hollywood skipped the third novel, The Lost Symbol, for reasons that donâ€™t really seem to matter  â€”   and Iâ€™ll risk being repetitive to state that itâ€™s not a very good movie. The point of this movie and its predecessors, The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, has never been to make great art. They get poor reviews and make a lot of money, and most people go home happy enough  â€”   including, presumably, Howard, Hanks, and whoever else is on the payroll"
202889,56,primary,11,"  As with its predecessors, Inferno features Hanks gamely playing Langdon and takes place over the course of a single day, as Langdon uses his knowledge about symbols and history to crack a historical scavenger hunt and save the world from whatever shadowy force is threatening it this time. (You donâ€™t need to see either The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons to follow along with this one.) This time around, that threat is Dr. Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster) who in the filmâ€™s opening moments is seen giving a   speech about the urgent need to reduce the number of humans on the planet by half, so as to keep us from sending ourselves into extinction. He, as you might guess, plans to do this winnowing himself  â€”   saving the human race by extinguishing half of it with a virus"
202889,57,secondary,178,"          There are all kinds of problems with this plan that Inferno never really addresses. For instance, about 95 percent of humanity will be infected, but only half will die. Which half and why? Is this selective, and if so, who gets selected, and why are people not more concerned about eugenics? Why will the surviving half not also die, if civilization is wiped out and they have to fight one another for survival? Also, if a population of about 8 billion is reduced to 4 billion, what will keep them from rapidly multiplying back up to 8 billion? Isnâ€™t this at best a   fix?    But the best policy with these movies is to not ask too many questions  â€”   a bit ironically, since the movie is peppered with Zobrist whispering â€seek and find,â€ which I can only assume is meant to echo Jesusâ€™s words in two Gospels. Any enjoyment derived from Inferno comes from trying to keep up with the actual plot, which contains some truly   twists but nonetheless probably shouldnâ€™t be spoiled. Iâ€™ll just leave it at this: Langdon wakes up in a hospital in Florence with   amnesia, tended to by Dr. Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones) who helps him escape a police officer whoâ€™s apparently after him. They return to her apartment, where they become convinced the US government is after him for some reason he canâ€™t really remember because, again, amnesia. (Amnesia, by the way, is the lazy writerâ€™s way to construct a mystery out of nothing very mysterious.)    Langdon circuitously realizes he has a tiny device in his possession that, when sprung, projects on Dr. Brooksâ€™s apartment wall an altered image of Botticelliâ€™s â€Map of Hell,â€ based on Danteâ€™s Inferno, which has inspired most of our conceptions of hell since. (The Bible itself is largely mum on the specific details of hell, save for some references to an unquenchable lake of fire.) In the Inferno, Dante depicts hell as comprising nine circles, corresponding roughly to the deadly sins, and he travels through those circles led by the poet Virgil (who has been sent by Beatrice, the symbol of divine love, who emerges in the later books of Danteâ€™s Divine Comedy)"
202889,58,secondary,269,"          Botticelli mapped out Danteâ€™s circles, but Langdon and Brooks notice thereâ€™s lettering on the painting, and some of the pieces have been rearranged. That sends them off on a scavenger hunt through Florence and, eventually, Istanbul. A classic tale of   falling through ceilings, and messages hidden on the back of medieval artifacts, Inferno is an extremely silly staging of a battle between   people, all of whom want to stave off the apocalypse but disagree about the best way to do that. The movie doesnâ€™t even bother to justify its own position on whether or not this is a good idea. And why should it? This is a puzzle box, not reality, and itâ€™s going to sell a lot of movie tickets. I left the theater feeling like the movie Iâ€™d just seen was frivolous and poorly plotted but sort of charming in its own way, and it moved along so fast I barely had time to register another plot hole before it soldiered on to the next picturesque location. But I couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that something was weird and wrong about it"
202889,59,secondary,198,"Into the Inferno is ostensibly about volcanoes but actually about belief systems As it happened, earlier that day Iâ€™d watched Into the Inferno (in theaters and on Netflix) which organizes itself around some of the worldâ€™s major active volcanoes, from Indonesia to Iceland. Werner Herzog travels alongside Cambridge volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer, whom he met while shooting his 2007 Antarctica doc, Encounters at the End of the World"
202889,60,primary,209,"       Rating  4     After I finished the movie, my husband asked me what Iâ€™d learned about volcanoes, and I realized that the answer was â€very little.â€ But thatâ€™s not a complaint. Through Herzogâ€™s eyes, volcanoes are majestic shapers of life. He films active lava flows as if they are magnificent art installations, their roiling magma and rippling cooling folds acting as tools of sculpture in the hands of the worldâ€™s most badass artist. Into the Inferno is less interested in science than it is in humanism, in prodding the civilizations that live in the shadow of these volcanoes. Every civilization has tales of its own creation and of future apocalypse  â€”   what if both were contained in a mountain, and that mountain loomed over your life? Imagine living beside a mountain that both gave rise to your world and could wipe it out at any moment. Would you fear it? Worship it? Sing about it? All of the above?             Herzog has never really been good about sticking to his ostensible subject. No matter what heâ€™s looking at  â€”   and talking about, in the accent and intonation that by now has risen to the level of    â€”   Herzog is just as interested in how humans live in the midst of the worldâ€™s mysteries as he is in those mysteries themselves. Cave paintings, grizzly bears, death row inmates, the internet, Antarctica: Theyâ€™re interesting to Herzog insofar as they touch imaginations and shape civilizations, and thatâ€™s why he points his camera at them. Every Herzog movie is, ultimately, about Herzog, and also about us. Thereâ€™s less Herzog voiceover in this film than usual, traded for more onscreen Oppenheimer, who talks with subjects about their lives in the volcanoesâ€™ shadows. Some are village leaders who are comfortable chatting about their relativesâ€™ ability to talk to the volcano but mystified by the scientistsâ€™ interest in it. The most gripping part of the film is a short but surreal section in which Oppenheimer and the crew, having been invited to collaborate with volcanologists in North Korea, gain rare access to the cloistered country, and Herzog comes along for the ride. In the first shot, Herzogâ€™s camera sits alongside Paektu Mountain, a huge volcano thatâ€™s considered the mythical birthplace of the Korean people. A group of young men in uniform approach, marching in formation. We, along with Herzog, assume they are soldiers, but it turns out they are university students, come to pay homage to the volcano. They sing, and as they do, Herzog pans across the line of them and solemnly entreats us to consider the same spectacle ever happening with university students in California"
202889,61,secondary,218,"  â€Everything we saw was an act of presentation, and we went for it,â€ says Herzog. â€There is no way to see this enigmatic country other than how it wants to present itself.â€ Soon we discover that Kim   who fought the Japanese and became the first president of the country (eventually declared â€president for eternity,â€ Herzog informs us) established his secret military base at the volcano, effectively   the countryâ€™s religious mythology about its own origin to establish his place in its pantheon of gods. Several guides take us around the mountain to different sculptures and, eventually, to the secret base itself, which Herzog says is a place that carries roughly as much weight in the North Korean imagination as Jesusâ€™s birthplace"
202889,62,primary,287,"Inferno never bothers to justify its conclusions Putting Inferno and Into the Inferno side by side yields parallels. Some are to be expected: Both, for instance, rely on a lot of fire imagery, which canâ€™t help but call to mind hell. Both talk a lot about the mass extinguishment of human life, along with the rebirth of the world. In that way, both are apocalyptic: In Inferno, Zobrist suggests we ought to bring on the apocalypse ourselves to save mankind, while in Into the Inferno, most people are aware of just how helpless they are in the face of a mighty volcano. But Inferno left me miffed because it is, at heart, a deeply inhuman story. I donâ€™t have a particular dog in the medieval Catholic fight, though I know Brown has been a figure of controversy for his perceived   stories, particularly in The Da Vinci Code. Heâ€™s claimed they are meant to entertain and promote spiritual discussion and debate. And thatâ€™s his prerogative"
202889,63,primary,296,"          And yet, whatever is true of his previous books and the movies based on them, Inferno is in some other category, precisely because there is nothing very spiritual about them. Set aside the   plot for a moment (which could promote conversation of a spiritual sort, however obliquely). In Inferno, the stories and symbols belonging to a faith tradition important to many people serve merely as a sort of decoder ring for a religiously tinted National Treasure. The actual meaning and content of those beliefs is excised in favor of a maudlin romantic plot and a mystery; anything that appears mysterious or supernatural is quickly explained away. It seems very strange that a story so surrounded by beauty, mystery, and gestures toward the divine could be so very cold and devoid of care for its characters. Inferno doesnâ€™t explicitly attack the Catholic Church in any manner. But it treads all over holy and formerly holy sites with nary a moment for wonder or contemplation"
202889,64,tertiary,181,"  Sure, the fate of the world is at stake. But if youâ€™re going to bring up hell and Danteâ€™s Beatrice, whisper â€seek and findâ€ over and over, and contemplate the extinction of humanity  â€”   if youâ€™re going to ponder the awesome fact that modern man holds in his hands the possibility to control his own destiny instead of leaving that fate with the gods, would it be too much to bring up metaphysics once or twice to explain why humans ought to survive? Or nah? [Spoiler, I guess] Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s extra strange that Inferno never bothers to justify its ultimate position, that it would be better for humans to continue on this apparently inexorable track toward overpopulation and hellish extinction rather than go along with Zobristâ€™s   plan. Near the end it seems briefly as if Langdon is having an attack of conscience for realizing he killed to save mankind  â€”   on a smaller scale, to be sure  â€”   but the moment passes, and with it, the opportunity to reflect on something bigger than a puzzle. But the fate of humanity is at stake here, for Peteâ€™s sake. And without being told that Zobrist was wrong, and without a way to justify Langdonâ€™s decision (religious, philosophical, or otherwise) Inferno just leaves us feeling as if he might have done the wrong thing"
202889,65,primary,236,"Into the Inferno takes belief seriously, no matter how strange Herzogâ€™s approach could not be more different. In fact, you could say that Into the Inferno is an inquiry into the nature of religion itself, and how people around the world develop the beliefs that give their lives meaning. The volcanoes are connected and give rise to the fundamental beliefs of the cultures around them, and while we could certainly just chuckle at some of those beliefs from our vantage points, Herzog wonâ€™t let us. â€There is no single [volcano] that is not connected to a belief system,â€ Herzog tells us  â€”   whether thatâ€™s magical, political, or religious. Herzogâ€™s approach takes belief seriously, no matter how improbable or illogical it sounds to the outsider. Brownâ€™s skims the symbols off religion for entertainment in the form of puzzles that can be unlocked in the space of a day (or a   movie)"
202889,66,primary,291,"           That in a nutshell captures the dichotomy of how we who fancy ourselves sophisticated and enlightened tend to handle religion. Religion can act just as a curious repository of aesthetics and symbols we can draw upon for our own purposes  â€”   think of how politicians and their surrogates so easily swipe biblical phrases to tug at our consciences, for instance. But peopleâ€™s dearly held beliefs, no matter how silly we might think they are from the outside, arenâ€™t really ours to use for our own entertainment purposes without even a nod to what they meant, and mean, to adherents. (Especially when your whole story is about mass death and destruction.)    Thatâ€™s why Herzogâ€™s approach is both respectful and deeply contemporary: It recognizes that belief takes a lot of shapes, not all of which are explicitly about the gods  â€”   the North Korea segment shows that  â€”   and that when weâ€™re confronted with belief systems that donâ€™t quite make sense to us, we might do well to just sit and listen. Into the Inferno is a strong argument for feeling a sense of wonder in the face of things you donâ€™t understand. Inferno, on the other hand, has no sense of wonder at all, no respect for the weight of its conclusions. Cheap tricks and symbols are all it has. "
216740,67,secondary,415,"         Eight years ago, unprecedented throngs of Americans rushed into the streets in the middle of the night. People cried, hugged strangers, kissed cops, shared champagne. The country had just elected its first black president, and it felt as if liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, were on the same team, if only for a rousing moment, and that team had just won the World Series. Of course, it quickly became clear that Barack Obama had won office in a divided nation hungry for change but also mistrustful of authority, suspicious of nearly everything. Donald Trumpâ€™s victory Tuesday night seemed unlikely to provoke any such unifying surge of goodwill and pride"

(Jabin Botsford   Washington Post)  Americans on election night of 2016 had the blues  â€”   anxious about the future, miffed about the lousy choices they faced, insecure about the nationâ€™s place in the world, bothered by each other. A presidential election is a reflection of the national culture and mood, and if the Obama election was a statement of optimism about the radical demographic, technological and social changes of recent decades, then what did Americansâ€™ choice of Trump really mean? It is, some voters said, an admission of exhaustion, a collective settling for the lesser of two evils in a country where people increasingly choose not to live near, associate with or listen to those who hold opposing political views. Not quite, other voters said. With or without Trumpâ€™s extraordinary appeal, Americans were determined this year to send the politicians a message about the pain caused by a   collapse of certainties about what America looks like, what constitutes a family and how we earn a living"

Tuesdayâ€™s vote left unresolved whether the ugly narrative of unprincipled demagogue vs. dishonest harridan really reflects a country that has fallen into coarse, raw hatred  â€”   or if the 2016 campaign was instead a symptom of the newly pervasive power of Facebook, Twitter and other social media.

By being blunt, heâ€™s saving your life. â€ Across the ideological divide, some see this yearâ€™s surly, sour campaign as a reflection of sentiments that have been plainly visible on the Internet for a long time but that just this year exploded into open expression. â€œFear and anger and misogyny and xenophobia donâ€™t change  â€”   they were always out there, but now those people can find each other so much more easily,â€ said Chip Franklin, a radio talk show host in San Francisco who built his career as a conservative, then shifted his politics to the left. â€œThis yearâ€™s anger is the same as any yearâ€™s anger, but whatâ€™s different now is that there are 30 different ways to express that anger and share it with people who would never have seen it before. Then along came Donald Trump, willing to say whatever people wanted him to say. â€ Even if he had lost, this would have been the year of Trump, a wholesale rejection of politics as usual. The thin enthusiasm for Clinton, the revival of the 1990s narrative painting her as dishonest and arrogant, and the dramatically rougher language deployed against her combined with Trumpâ€™s ability to give voice to the nationâ€™s id. The result was a cavalcade of insults, threats and unchecked assertions flying under the flag of   correctness. The candidates took body blows from all sides, a level of vitriol that was commonplace in Americaâ€™s first century but had calmed considerably during the decades when the three major TV networks set the nationâ€™s political tone. This year, it was almost remarkable that no candidate got challenged to a duel. Congress, the news media and politicians overall  â€”   the usual basement dwellers in any accounting of the nationâ€™s   institutions  â€”   fell to new lows. But the biggest shift seemed to take place on the smallest stages. â€˜Devolving into tribesâ€™ As Jane Beard waited for her prescription at the Walgreens in Edgewater, Md. a baby in a stroller caught her eye. She played a quick bit of    looked up and caught the boyâ€™s fatherâ€™s eye. He smiled and leaned in: â€œListen, I want to ask you something. Are you a Hillary voter? You look like a Hillary voter. â€ For an instant, Beard  â€”   in yoga pants, a sweatshirt and little Ecco shoes  â€”   thought the man had sensed a kindred spirit. â€œYou bet I am!â€ she replied. Suddenly, the man unleashed a river of invective: â€œItâ€™s     like you who are helping that     win. Sheâ€™s a murderer. â€ He went on, and it didnâ€™t get any nicer. Rattled, Beard asked: â€œWhy did you even come up to me? I never said a word to you. All I did was exist in the world in this store .â€‰.â€‰. â€ â€œYou exist!â€ the man hissed. â€œ      like you exist and youâ€™re     up the country  â€”   our country. â€ Beard searched for the best retort. â€œItâ€™s my country, too,â€ she blurted. She quickly left the store, sat down in her car, caught her breath and posted about the incident on Facebook. Within minutes, a virtual community embraced Beard, a former actress who coaches executives on public speaking. They bemoaned the loss of civility in so many places. They told stories of angry confrontations launched from both sides of the divide. They said theyâ€™d refrained from putting out yard signs this year because people have gotten so riled up. â€œTruly sadly, I feel just about the same way as this nut  â€”   albeit in reverse,â€ one of Beardâ€™s friends wrote. â€œI hate that this election has brought out these feelings in me. â€ But one man assured Beard that â€œyou met an outlier. The vast majority of people are good and kind. â€ Another urged her to â€œlook at the support you have catalyzed with this post. Look at the love that holds you and everyone woven into this tapestry. That is what is real. â€ Beard, who lives in Churchton, Md. near the Chesapeake Bay, had already had three Hillary signs stolen from her yard. On Halloween, she took down her latest sign, just for the evening, â€œbecause we didnâ€™t want people not to come to our house. â€ But in the week after the drugstore confrontation, Beard, 60, found support from neighbors, including Trump supporters, one of whom ran into her at the Baltimore airport, hugged her, and said, â€œOh my gosh, Jane, we can still be friends. â€ Still, she struggled with the meaning of her moment in Walgreens. â€œPeople are scared,â€ she concluded. â€œThat man is raising a kid that will hear that language and spout that language. Yet I was soothed by all the outpouring. What makes me sad is that weâ€™re devolving into tribes. I thought we were all the American tribe. â€     Clinton holds a rally early Tuesday morning at N. C. State University in Raleigh. (Melina   Washington Post)     Suporters cheer Trump in Grand Rapids, Mich. on Monday. (Jabin   Washington Post)    â€˜Why are we enemies?â€™ Deep divisions and despairing dissatisfaction over politics and the nationâ€™s direction are nothing new. â€œAmerica never was America to me,â€ Langston Hughes wrote in â€œLet America Be America,â€ his 1935 poem. â€œI am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart. I am the Negro bearing slaveryâ€™s scars. .â€‰.â€‰. I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek  â€”   and finding only the same old stupid plan of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak. â€ Hughes concluded that the people, not the politicians, could â€œbring back our mighty dream again. .â€‰.â€‰. I swear this oath  â€”   America will be!â€ That essentially American optimism has not disappeared. Many Trump supporters, drawn by their candidateâ€™s dark vision of a lost and failing country that â€œI alone can fix,â€ thought of themselves as a movement to restore greatness. â€œMore than anything else, Trump picked up on a growing sense that elections donâ€™t have much impact on the direction of the country, that power is increasingly distant from the people,â€ said Chris Buskirk, publisher of American Greatness, a   blog. Buskirk saw Trump connecting with voters on messages that had more in common with Democrats Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren than with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( . ): border security, a â€œ â€ trade policy aimed at â€œbringing Wall Street to heelâ€ and a foreign policy skeptical of military intervention. That message  â€”   American jobs, America First, Fortress America  â€”   hit home with millions of people who have felt disconnected from, and disdained by, the elites for decades. In 1996, James Dobson, the head of Focus on the Family, one of the countryâ€™s largest and most influential evangelical Christian organizations, said: â€œPeople inside the Beltway are not aware of the multiple millions of Americans out there who believe things differently than is perceived in Washington. Theyâ€™re very concerned about .â€‰.â€‰. a moral meltdown in this country. Theyâ€™re waiting for some political figure to articulate those views. And no one does. â€ Then came Trump. His unique blend of celebrity, ego and a mischievous delight in outraging the elites  â€”   as well as his confidence that he would be judged by the lax standards applied to Hollywood and sports figures rather than the unforgiving rules that govern politicians  â€”   enabled him to win over millions who heard in his message clear echoes of their   grumbles to friends on Facebook. Trumpâ€™s rhetoric and character liberated some Americans to open an ugly vein of animosity. â€œThis year has revealed our underbelly, and a lot of people donâ€™t like what we see,â€ said Jim Daly, Focus on the Familyâ€™s current president. America, Daly said, has morphed into â€œa   society,â€ a â€œdepraved cultureâ€ in which the more conservative party chose a nominee who boasted of his sexual assaults"
216740,72,tertiary,622,"  At the Grand Rapids Trump rally Monday. (Jabin   Washington Post)  Clintonâ€™s decades in politics, her emotionally distanced and guarded presentation, and her legalistic language nearly smothered the revolutionary nature of her own candidacy  â€”   oddly, the possibility of electing the first female president was rarely mentioned through most of the campaign. (When some in the campaign sought to go big with the historic nature of Clintonâ€™s candidacy, they were told by those in charge that many Americans just didnâ€™t want to hear it.)    Was the Trump victory a statement condoning sexism, boorish behavior and coarse aggression? Would President Obama still insist, as he did last summer, that â€œAmerica is not as divided as some have suggestedâ€? In recent days, many Americans expressed a palpable desire to relieve the tension of division that is evident in the 56 percent of Americans who, according to The Washington   poll, were anxious about Clinton becoming president and the 61 percent who felt that way about Trump winning. â€œEverybody is against everybody. Why?â€ Mary White asked in Des Moines last week after two police officers were shot and killed. She brought her son to a makeshift memorial, where she found a morsel of hope, and a question: â€œLook how this community has come together, people who donâ€™t know each other. Why canâ€™t our nation come together? What happened between   and now? Why are we enemies?â€ Every chapter in the American story so far has resolved into hope. The Civil War birthed Reconstruction. The riots and generational strife of the 1960s settled into sweeping social and cultural change. Before the vote, the University of Virginiaâ€™s president, Teresa Sullivan, appealed to students to be civil to one another after the vote. She taught them about the bitter election of 1800, when a   Adams newspaper warned that Thomas Jefferson would create a nation in which â€œmurder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will openly be taught and practiced. â€ Jefferson won and set about trying to get people to â€œunite with one heart and one mind,â€ to restore â€œthat harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things .â€‰.â€‰. â€ Daly, the evangelical leader, said he intends to reach out to gay activists and abortion rights advocates â€œto build bridges, just trying to create discussions and friendships. I donâ€™t know if it will work. When you try to do that, you get killed by the extremes on both sides. The uncorking of incivility makes it hard: Discussions that used to die among friends now become unbridled castigating of other people. Iâ€™m hopeful that this election is a blip. Weâ€™re now at a point where we cannot say that civility is a shared value, and I donâ€™t see how we can keep our democracy together without being able to talk to each other. â€               Caption   People around the globe watched as Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States"

179349,74,primary,475," While he has swallowed a big budget cut, had his chosen deputy vetoed, and been dismissed as invisible in his own building, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is playing a patient game to gain influence by avoiding public conflicts with the White House, six current and former U. S. officials said on Thursday. The former Exxon Mobil Corp CEO faces multiple challenges in his unfamiliar role as chief U. S. diplomat, including a boss in U. S. President Donald Trump who makes unpredictable policy pronouncements and does not take kindly to criticism or contradiction, said four current officials. Relations between U. S. presidents and their chief diplomats have varied widely in history, but those between Trump and Tillerson are especially important because of potential conflicts between the unsettled state of the world and Trumpâ€™s â€America Firstâ€ agenda, two of the officials said. As a result, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, Tillerson is trying to keep a low profile, which is his natural instinct, and seeking a way to make his case on foreign policy without being drawn into losing battles. One case in point is Thursdayâ€™s White House proposal to cut spending on U. S. diplomacy and foreign aid by some 28 percent, a sign that the State Department and U. S. Agency for International Development are not Trump priorities. On Thursday in Tokyo, Tillerson said the State Departmentâ€™s current spending is â€simply not sustainable,â€ and accepted the â€challengeâ€ Trump had given in proposing to cut more than a quarter of his agencyâ€™s budget. â€He is making a very sensible calculation,â€ said a former U. S. official, noting that Congress, not the president, holds the purse strings. â€You state your loyalty to the president, and then you know that you will not actually have to live with the presidentâ€™s budget.â€ NO WAY TO WIN â€™  â€™ BATTLES Two current and former officials said Tillerson is no stranger to cost cuts, having lived through waves of them at Exxon, and they suggested that he had convinced the White House to allow him to make many of the cuts himself"
179349,75,primary,188,"   â€Tillerson isnâ€™t opposed to cutting the budget at all, but he figured out that he couldnâ€™t win    battles with the president and the people close to him, so heâ€™s pursuing a different strategy, arguing that he canâ€™t make wise decisions about what to cut until heâ€™s more familiar with his department and its budget,â€ said one veteran State Department official. Michael Anton, a National Security Council spokesman, said Tillerson is held in high regard at the White House. â€President Trump has the utmost confidence in the Secretary of State and looks forward to Mr. Tillerson implementing a bold agenda to revitalize American foreign policy,â€ Anton said. While he is delaying some of the drastic cuts the White House wanted, it is far from clear that Tillerson can prevail over Trump aides such as Steve Bannon who want to dismantle parts of the federal government and limit U. S. engagement with the world, said three of the current and former officials"

187630,79,secondary,46," Ride hailing app company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER. UL] is generating more than $1 billion in profit a year in its top 30 cities globally, and partly using that money to bankroll its expansion in China, Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said in an interview. The company said in February it was losing more than $1 billion a year in Chinaâ€™s   ride hailing market, where it is battling large local incumbents to win customers. Kalanick said China was the companyâ€™s most intense market, but also a crucible for new ideas that it has exported to other markets, and that its investment here was sustainable. â€If you took our top 30 cities today, today theyâ€™re generating over $1 billion in profit a year, just our top 30 cities. And that profit multiplies every year because weâ€™re growing,â€ he said on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in the Chinese island province of Hainan. Other cities among the 400 where Uber operates were also profitable, he added. â€So that helps us to sustainably invest in our Chinese efforts. .. Because of the profits we have globally, this is something we can do for the long run,â€ he said late on Thursday. Uber and Chinaâ€™s Didi Kuaidi, backed by Chinese technology giants Tencent Holdings Ltd ( ) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( ) have both spent heavily to subsidize fares to gain market share, betting on Chinaâ€™s   transport market becoming the worldâ€™s biggest. The strategy seems to be working for Uber. The companyâ€™s market share in China has grown quickly, rising from about 1 percent to 2 percent in January 2015 to about 30 percent now, Kalanick said. Chinaâ€™s transport minister said earlier this month fare subsidies and the supplementing of driver wages by   companies were competitively unfair and unsustainable in the  . The San   company founded in 2009 was starting to test new products in China first and one example he noted was UberCOMMUTE, a carpooling app that was first launched in Chengdu last September and later expanded elsewhere. â€The key for (us in) China is to move fast,â€ Kalanick said. â€If we launch in the U. S. and then it gets copied in China, weâ€™ll be behind. So weâ€™re starting to orient some of our innovation at China first,â€ he added, highlighting the cutthroat competition. The companyâ€™s Chinese business boosted its valuation in January to more than $8 billion after raising more than $1 billion in its latest funding round. Kalanick said so far Uber had not faced major regulatory challenges in China, possibly because the government has been trying to drive innovation and Uber fits the narrative. Kalanick declined to say when he thought Uber would turn a profit in the worldâ€™s most populous country, but he seemed to be enjoying the ride regardless. â€I was in China 70 days last year and 100 times a day someone would say â€™Travis, no Internet technology company has ever succeeded.

C. where he was serving a life sentence. He was 78. Kenneth McKoy, a Bureau of Prisons official, confirmed the death to the Associated Press. The cause was diabetes and heart disease. Abdel Rahman, who was blind from an early age, had denounced secular tendencies in other Muslims since the 1960s and was linked for decades with extremist Islamist circles in Egypt and abroad. He was twice acquitted of helping plot the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat  â€”   whom he denounced as â€œnot a Muslimâ€  â€”   and built an alliance with   leader Osama bin Laden while living in Afghanistan in the 1980s. After moving to the United States in 1990, Abdel Rahman preached at storefront mosques in Brooklyn and New Jersey, and came under federal scrutiny after a 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center left six people dead and more than 1, 000 injured. Several of his followers were convicted in the bombing, although Abdel Rahman was not.

I did not give orders. I have nothing to do with anything. â€ Even while he being held for trial, Abdel Rahman delivered long sermons from jail, with his telephone messages amplified by microphones in the mosques frequented by his followers. During the   trial, Abdel Rahmanâ€™s   defense team included celebrity lawyers William Kunstler and onetime U. S. attorney general Ramsey Clark. The evidence included secretly recorded wiretaps, which prosecutors said indicated Abdel Rahmanâ€™s intent to wage a holy war in the United States.

He preached at a small mosque in rural Egypt and became known for his criticism of the secular leadership of Nasser, calling him â€œthe wicked pharaoh. â€ After being jailed for several months for his comments, Abdel Rahman spent three years teaching in Saudi Arabia, where he became more deeply immersed in a militant,   form of Islam. Back in Egypt in the late 1970s, he was seen as the spiritual leader of     a radical group later tied to terrorist activities. Abdel Rahman became an outspoken opponent of Sadat, whose overtures to Israel, culminating in the 1979 Camp David Accords, were seen as anathema to conservative Muslims. The Egyptian president was killed by assassins on Oct. 6, 1981. Although he denounced Sadat as an infidel, Abdel Rahman was acquitted of any role in the assassination plot. He later fled to Afghanistan, where he was closely allied with  â€™s growing   movement. From 1985 to 1990, Abdel Rahman traveled widely throughout Europe, Africa, Asia and the United States, speaking to Muslim audiences. He spent a considerable amount of time in Peshawar, Pakistan, a hotbed of radical Islamist sentiment. By 1990, Abdel Rahman had returned to Egypt, where he was under close watch by authorities and barred from leaving the country. He managed to escape, according to one account, by being smuggled out in a washing machine. Despite being on   watch lists, he traveled to Sudan, where he received a visa to enter the United States. After his arrival in New Jersey, he obtained a green card for residency. When it was revoked in 1992, he asked for political asylum. Abdel Rahman had two wives and 10 children; a complete list of survivors could not be confirmed. One of his sons, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, was killed by a U. S. drone strike in Afghanistan in 2011. In 2005, one of his lawyers, Lynne Stewart, was convicted of providing material aid to a terrorist organization for smuggling messages from Abdel Rahman to the     organization. After first receiving a   prison sentence, which she began to serve in 2009, she was resentenced in 2010  â€”   to 10 years  â€”   but was released in 2013 for health reasons. In 2012, Egyptâ€™s president, Mohamed Morsi, called for Abdel Rahman to be transferred to Egypt for â€œhumanitarian reasonsâ€ as part of a prisoner exchange with the United States.

213422,90,primary,125,"     LONDON  â€”   It has only been two weeks since the world awoke to the news that Britain had done the unthinkable, voting to exit the European Union. But youâ€™d need a comprehensive scorecard to keep track of all the carnage since among those who led the charge for Brexit. The betrayals and the backstabbing. The revenge and the retribution. With chilling efficiency, the main players in the drive for an exit have now themselves been forced to take their leave. If you havenâ€™t been following closely, hereâ€™s a quick summary of whatâ€™s befallen the actors in this very British drama. Boris Johnson    (Jack   Images)  Who is he? Heâ€™s the man who would have been king, the onetime prohibitive favorite to be the next prime minister. Who betrayed him? Michael Gove, Johnsonâ€™s   campaign manager and chum from his Oxford days. Goveâ€™s   announcement that he would run for prime minister knocked Johnson from the contest even before he could enter. Did he get his revenge? Sort of. He endorsed Andrea Leadsom for prime minister. (See below.)   Michael Gove    (Simon  )  Who is he? The Brutus of British politics Whom did he betray? Johnson. But to Gove it was not a betrayal. It was   service to his country. And how did that work out for him? Not well. He got knocked out of the balloting to be prime minister after Johnson backed Leadsom and other Tories recoiled at Goveâ€™s perceived treachery"

Then when it happened, he promptly quit politics because he said he wanted his life back. Who betrayed him? Douglas Carswell. the only member of Farageâ€™s party who holds a seat in Parliament. The two are longtime antagonists. This was Carswellâ€™s reaction when Farage stepped down:   ðŸ˜Ž  â€”   Douglas Carswell MP (@DouglasCarswell) July 4, 2016   The Daily Mail and the Sun   Fridayâ€™s Sun front page via @tnewtondunn The Iron Mayden#tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers pic. twitter"

216781,95,tertiary,829,"         We donâ€™t know much yet about what Donald Trump will do as president, but the barest outlines of his agenda are coming into view. It seems clear that Trump will pursue tax cuts, including big ones for top earners and businesses; deregulation across the board in areas such as finance; the repeal of Obamacare; more   immigration policies; and more spending in two specific areas  â€”   infrastructure and the military. Which raises the possibility of a nightmare scenario for economic progressivism. It goes like this: Increased spending helps boost the economy, which is already accelerating, even as Republicans give the credit for it to tax cuts (especially at the top) and deregulation, validating their narrative that Big Government under Obama is what held the economy back from its full potential until President Trump unshackled it. In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Trump promised to â€œrebuild our infrastructure,â€ adding that â€œwe will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. â€ While Trumpâ€™s advisers say his plan for infrastructure spending would employ a tax credit scheme that would supposedly mean it costs the government nothing  â€”   which is debatable  â€”   it would ultimately pump a lot of spending into the economy. Itâ€™s unclear whether House Republicans will go along with the plan. As Steven Dennis reports, House Speaker Paul Ryan has made only the most perfunctory negative noises about it, and the general goal of more infrastructure spending already has the support of Democrats in Congress, so it seems plausible that Trump might end up getting his way. Trump has also promised to rebuild our â€œdepletedâ€ military, which would seem to mean more spending there, too. Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans have signaled that they will try to quickly repeal Obamacare, and while itâ€™s not clear whether Trump will try to replace it with anything, he may well support repeal, as he, too, has promised to do. Trumpâ€™s tax plan calls for deep cuts across the board, including on businesses and top earners, and his transition team is already signaling he will move to deregulate Wall Street. Itâ€™s always possible, of course, that Trump will make good on his vow to start trade wars or implement protectionism, which economists have warned would prove destructive to the economy. But itâ€™s also possible that his bluster on trade may not end up producing much, and Trump will instead govern much more as a conventional Republican, implementing huge tax cuts and running up the deficit, while deregulating across the board  â€”   with perhaps much more infrastructure spending than Republicans might traditionally support thrown into the mix. The Market Monetarist blog argues that the likelihood of such a scenario might be why the markets are no longer panicking over the prospect of a Trump presidency. People may be concluding that Trump will not actually make good on his promises on trade, the Market Monetarist notes, adding that they may now expect Trump to be a Republican â€œ  Keynesian. â€ Combine that with financial deregulation and Obamacare repeal, and add in some form of stepped up deportations in line with what he has proposed, and we might be getting a bit of a sense of what Trump might do. Obviously progressives would be happy to see more spending on infrastructure spending and job creation, but they would recoil at repeal of Obamacare and financial regulations and stepped up deportations. I asked Mike Konczal, a senior fellow at the   Roosevelt Institute, if he could envision this scenario, and if so, whether that might produce an economic boost from spending that Republicans could then also credit to Obamacare repeal, financial deregulation, and increased immigration enforcement (which, they might argue, helps explain why U. S. workers are feeling better about the economy). Konczal agreed that this was possible. He said such an agenda could amount to â€œReactionary Keynesianism,â€ which essentially involves boosting the economy to full employment, but in ways that nonetheless increase inequality. Thatâ€™s because it would involve cutting taxes in ways that primarily benefit the top, and boosting spending only in certain areas (such as on infrastructure and the military) while cutting it back in others (such as on the social safety yet and on other social investments that Republicans traditionally oppose, such as Green Energy). Konczal emailed: Itâ€™s possible that Republicans run large deficits on tax cuts for the rich, military spending, perhaps some infrastructure, while also deregulating finance, energy, and other industries and running a massive deportation project of undocumented workers. A nightmare scenario would be the spending from the first leading to a strong economic rebound from the Great Recession  â€”   what John Galbraith would call Reactionary Keynesianism  â€”   and the GOP and voters crediting that rebound to deregulation and immigration. You heard it here first."

Mike Thompson ( .) a chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force who noted he owns a firearm. â€œThe Republican leadership will not allow these bills to comeâ€ to a vote. Members were splayed across the well, leaning against podiums and chairs in a manner that would have earned them a reprimand if the House were in session. The   cameras, which are controlled by the House, were turned off and so were the microphones  â€”   leading some members to jokingly argue about who should take the next turn to speak based on who had the loudest voice. While itâ€™s against House rules to take photos or video on the floor, at one point   carried live footage of the   via the Periscope feed of Rep. Scott Peters (Calif. ).

They also asked Speaker Paul D.

212971,99,secondary,426,"She did not say if Republicans had a plan to resolve the impasse with Democrats. Pelosi said members were committed to holding the floor because after a series of mass shootings marked by prejudice  â€”   the recent attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando and the shooting last year at South Carolinaâ€™s predominantly African American Emanuel AME church  â€”   and homeland security concerns, members had reached a breaking point. House Democrats are trying to stay â€œin syncâ€ with the Senate in making their demands, Pelosi explained. Thatâ€™s why the only two measures they are specifically demanding votes on would prevent suspected terrorists on the governmentâ€™s watch lists from purchasing firearms and expand background checks. The Senate considered proposals on these two issues earlier this week. â€œThe others, we canâ€™t say 85 to 90 percent of the public support,â€ Pelosi explained, adding that the chances of passing an assault weapons ban in this Congress are â€œhopeless. â€ â€œBut the other two shouldnâ€™t be, because they are bipartisan,â€ Pelosi said.

212341,101,tertiary,219,"     Candace Bushnell  â€”   yes, that Candace Bushnell, who wrote the original â€œSex and the Cityâ€ columns that spawned the TV series  â€”   gave Tinder a spin (or 20) and wrote all about it for Cosmopolitan. Itâ€™s been a while since sheâ€™s been on the prowl. Bushnell wrote in her Cosmo essay that she hadnâ€™t been on a date since 2002, when she met the man whoâ€™s now her  . â€œWhen people asked me about dating,â€ she writes, â€œI would look at them like they were crazy. â€ Iâ€™m one of those people. Last year, when Bushnell made a stop in Washington, D. C. on a book tour for her latest novel, she came by The Washington Post and we recorded a podcast episode about what has changed for single women since the 1980s and what hasnâ€™t. And when I asked her about how technology has changed dating, she didnâ€™t have much to say  â€”   she hadnâ€™t dated in years and she didnâ€™t want to talk about it. Due to Cosmoâ€™s prodding, Bushnell has broken that streak. But first, of course, a ladiesâ€™ night! Bushnell invited six women (ages 22 to 34) over to her place to drink champagne and help her figure out the dating app. Here are a few things Bushnell learned from her conversations with the Youngs and through her own Tindering. There arenâ€™t a lot of men her age on Tinder. Thereâ€™s been a lot written about   and   single moms using Tinder for casual sex. But what about the age bracket just above that? At 57, Bushnell swiped through two men who were 55+. (â€œApparently Tinder had automatically assumed that a   woman would want to date â€˜ â€™ men and set my range to 55 and older. Well, they were wrong,â€ she writes.) Then she set her age range to 22 to 38 and found that â€œthis is where the action was. â€ Tinder is addictive: â€œItâ€™s like being in Vegasâ€ The younger women schooling Bushnell in Tinder had lots of negative things to say about it: Thereâ€™s no context to your conversations with matches, so itâ€™s hard to feel attracted to someone or to keep the conversation going. Itâ€™s â€œboringâ€ and â€œdraining,â€ the Youngs say. The guys on Tinder use their ADD diagnoses to explain why theyâ€™re not texting back. And if they do, theyâ€™re reluctant to make plans for anything resembling an actual date. Theyâ€™ll send pics of that body part, and itâ€™s hard to tell whoâ€™s nice and who could be dangerous. But those kinds of things donâ€™t happen to Bushnell. Sheâ€™s just giddy that there are so many single men saying nice things to her, like complimenting her eyes. â€œIt was like being in Vegas,â€ she writes. â€œI was addicted. I couldnâ€™t stop talking about it. â€ Itâ€™s easy to look better than reality. Could be that all those younger men were interested in her because Bushnellâ€™s profile is full of photos of her much younger self? â€œBefore Iâ€™d even had my first Tinder date, Iâ€™d become one of those people who makes themselves out to be taller, better looking, bigger titted, richer, more glamorous, better traveled, better connected, more successful, and younger than they actually are IRL. â€ Ah, how quickly she learns how to play the game. Sheâ€™s too good for Tinder"
212341,102,primary,10,"In five minutes of swiping through the younger age bracket, Bushnell had 12 matches. Then the messages started rolling in: â€œYouâ€™re too good for this app,â€ one of them said. â€œThese men didnâ€™t know me, but they already knew I was too good for this app. Yes. Yes, I was. â€ A normal personâ€™s profile might boast: â€œMy friends say Iâ€™m attractive, humble and a total catch. â€ Bushnell pulls that trick while also admitting that theyâ€™re right. And keeps on swiping. Is this what Carrie Bradshaw would do? It most certainly is. Dating 30 years ago was better. â€œSure there was plenty of bad stuff,â€ Bushnell writes of dating in a   era. â€œBut there was also the luxury of time. Of getting to know someone. Of not having to decide in two minutes if you wanted to have sex with him. Of feeling at least a little bit courted. â€ She describes a date of yore  â€”   you might go out to dinner, taking a walk afterward  â€”   and her millennial companions swoon. â€œEveryone in our generation finds that kind of romance so appealing,â€ one of them says, â€œbut at the same time, itâ€™s just not realistic. â€ Isnâ€™t it, though? Iâ€™ve been on plenty of romantic walks. Bonus if thereâ€™s gelato. Even when itâ€™s good   â€¦     Spoiler alert: Bushnellâ€™s first Tinder date with â€œJudeâ€ was pretty great. Heâ€™s taller than she expected and   than his pictures. â€œHad I found a Tinder unicorn?â€ Bushnell asks. â€œHe was not only attractive, but he was getting bonus points for even agreeing to see a feminist movie. â€ Bonus points indeed! They didnâ€™t have much in common other than being on Tinder, but Bushnell ruled it a success and calls a friend to tell her about it. â€œHonestly, it couldnâ€™t have gone better,â€ she tells her friend. â€œJude wasnâ€™t anything like what everyone said the men were like. He was nice. Nice. And heâ€™s from the Midwest. And heâ€™s tall. He seemed to be quite intelligent. Overall, he was an attractive, kind, thinking person, and again, it couldnâ€™t have gone better. â€   â€¦     Itâ€™s not all that good. â€œWhile Iâ€™d had a good experience on Tinder,â€ Candace writes, â€œmy experience was not what most women experienced. â€ And she feels a little bad about that. According to her date, most women experience a mix of â€œdisrespect, disappointment, deception, and desperationâ€ on Tinder because theyâ€™re treated as objects or commodities and their matches are constantly trading up. â€œWhy shouldnâ€™t people meet up on Tinder and end up getting married?â€ Bushnell writes. â€œEven I was falling under Tinderâ€™s sway. â€ People do meet on Tinder and get married. But thatâ€™s the exception, the   ending most Tinderfolk donâ€™t get. And then comes a classic   line: â€œI thought I understood,â€ Bushnell writes, â€œTinder was like that bad boyfriend you kept going back to who was never going to change. Was Tinder the new Mr. Big?â€ She determines that Tinder isnâ€™t Mr. Big, a person or a thing singles canâ€™t quit even though it doesnâ€™t treat them right. That would be too tidy an ending, but there is some truth to the comparison. For more from Candace Bushnell on the   life, hereâ€™s our 2015 conversation below"

194875,104,secondary,76," A U. S. judge on Monday ordered the unsealing of the application used to obtain a search warrant that allowed the FBI to gain access to emails related to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s private server before the Nov. 8 election. U. S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan directed the release by Tuesday of redacted materials used to obtain a search warrant after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey informed Congress of newly discovered emails on Oct. 28. Comeyâ€™s letter drew new attention to a damaging issue for Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and roiled the campaign 11 days before the Nov. 8 election, won by Republican Donald Trump. The search warrant materialsâ€™ release sought by Randol Schoenberg, a Los   lawyer, who in court papers said transparency was crucial given the potential influence the probe had on the electionâ€™s outcome. Sources close to the investigation have said the emails were discovered during an unrelated probe into former Democratic U. S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. In his order, Castel said he would allow the redaction of the identities of two unnamed individuals, one of whom is subject to an â€ongoing criminal investigation.â€ But he said the â€strong presumption of access attached to the search warrant and related materials is not overcome by any remaining privacy interest of Secretary Clinton.â€ Lawyers for Clinton and Abedin did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did the U. S. Justice Department. A lawyer for Weiner had no immediate comment. Clinton used the server while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. In July, Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought over Clintonâ€™s handing of classified information in the emails, although he said she and her colleagues were â€extremely carelessâ€ in handling such information. In his Oct. 28 letter to Congress, Comey said emails potentially related to the Clinton server probe had been discovered in an â€unrelated case.â€ Sources close to the investigation have said the emails were discovered during an unrelated probe into Weiner following a media report that he engaged in sexually explicit cellphone and online messaging with a    girl. Federal investigators got a warrant to examine the emails to see if they were related to the probe into Clintonâ€™s private server. Only two days before the election, Comey disclosed that the emails did nothing to change his earlier recommendation"

They are running departments with missions they have repeatedly disparaged, with employees who are secretly  â€”   and on occasion publicly  â€”   hostile. Across the agencies, these Cabinet members have made very public efforts to court their staff, yet frequently are crafting key initiatives in private.

But when the agency decided to reconsider a controversial HUD policy granting transgender people access to   shelters of their choice, Carson angered the staffers who had crafted the policy by excluding them from the discussion. White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said in an email that President Trumpâ€™s Cabinet members are determined to overhaul the way their agencies  operate. The president â€œhas recruited an incredibly talented group of individuals to serve in his Cabinet  â€”   one of most visible and active Cabinets in recent history,â€ Strom said. She added, â€œHe has instructed them to work with both political appointees and career employees to streamline the federal government to make it smarter, more effective and more responsive to the American people. â€  [HUD Secretary Carson sings a new tune about federal employees]  Among all the Cabinet members, DeVos and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have faced the most vocal resistance from employees, despite efforts to win them over. Unlike her predecessors, DeVos no longer uses the private, express elevator to reach her   suite, taking the same ones as everyone else, and has given up the agencyâ€™s private chef, according to spokeswoman Liz Hill. But some employees dismiss her lunches in the cafeteria as photo ops. DeVos has made more of an impact with her decision to rescind a department policy requiring school districts to let transgender students use restrooms and other facilities of their choice. Her decision to reverse that policy  â€”   coupled with her refusal to say that she would block federal funding for private schools that discriminate against LGBT students  â€”   has prompted some agency employees to begin talking about resigning. One staffer who recently quit said he had been disappointed not only by DeVosâ€™s refusal to stand up for LGBT students at a Senate hearing in May, but also by the way he said she refrained from committing to protect African American and disabled students. He criticized â€œthe few and general ways the secretary has claimed to be standing up for students and families. â€ DeVos, who has called such accusations â€œhurtful,â€ says she is opposed to discrimination of any kind and that any school accepting federal funds must abide by federal law"
208743,109,secondary,262,"[White House installs aides in agencies as Trumpâ€™s eyes and ears]  At the EPA, Pruittâ€™s relationship with the agency was destined to be difficult from the outset because as Oklahoma attorney general, he had sued the EPA more than a dozen times, challenging its regulations policing greenhouse gas emissions, toxic emissions from power plants and the dredging of waterways. Pruitt has clashed with many staffers over the issue of climate change, in part by questioning the extent to which human activity is driving global warming. Some employees at the agencyâ€™s headquarters grouse about having to walk by a sign featuring Pruitt shaking hands with miners. When Pruittâ€™s appointees directed that the agency take down its climate Web pages containing scientific data and policy details, career officials initially balked. The pages have been removed from the EPAâ€™s website. Employees at the agencyâ€™s regional office in Chicago have participated in nearly a   public protests over the agencyâ€™s budget and administration policy decisions, including the U. S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Still, EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said that Pruitt has found â€œthe vast majority of the staff are committed to working with us,â€ and he is working to follow the agencyâ€™s statutory authority. She added that he â€œdoesnâ€™t experience the tension that is drummed up in the press. â€ At the Energy Department, Secretary Rick Perry is running an agency that he had promised, as a presidential candidate in 2012, to eliminate. (He had famously forgotten the Energy Departmentâ€™s name during a presidential debate.) Since taking over, he has kept a lower profile than many other Cabinet secretaries. But Perry has also praised some aspects of the agency, such as its national  laboratories. â€œItâ€™s good to be able to realize when youâ€™ve made an error and admit it,â€ Perry said during a stop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory last month. â€œIâ€™m very happy that Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to be associated with this agency now. â€ The spending cuts included in the administrationâ€™s budget, drafted with limited input from the agencies themselves, have left many Cabinet members in a difficult position as they defend the White Houseâ€™s plan while in some cases seeking to soften the blow. DeVos has backed a budget proposal that would slash more than 13 percent of the Education Departmentâ€™s budget while investing in her top priority, school choice. Pruitt privately pressed for less draconian cuts than those proposed by the White House but was rebuffed, according to senior administration officials briefed on the process. Once the White House settled on a 31 percent cut in the EPAâ€™s budget, Pruitt defended the reductions, although he identified a handful of programs he hopes Congress will restore. After initial budget figures were released, both Carson and Zinke vowed to restore some of the money that was cut. Carson urged his staff in a memo to disregard the â€œpreliminary numbersâ€  â€”   only to see the final reductions be even deeper. HUDâ€™s budget is to be reduced by 16 percent and Interiorâ€™s by 12 percent. Zinke said last month that he plans to eliminate 4, 000 jobs. Officials have declined to detail what, if anything, Carson and Zinke did to push for more  money. Carson and Zinke seem to have made some inroads, although modest, with their employees. Carson has tried to get to know his staff, holding events at least once a week at agency offices across the country, including job fairs and town halls for career employees, according to HUD spokesman Raffi Williams. After Carsonâ€™s first speech to his staff, some employees grilled him about his priorities. But one staffer, who did not give her name, praised him for addressing the â€œuncertaintiesâ€ that she had her colleagues had about the new administration. Many HUD employees, however, remain skeptical of Carson because of his lack of expertise in housing, his support for scaling back   programs, and his comments in a radio interview last month that poverty is a â€œstate of mind. â€ Zinke has sought to boost morale through several initiatives, including a new   policy for sexual misconduct and efforts to secure more comfortable employee uniforms. But he has upset some of his career employees by asking them to brief him on Interior policies, such as regulating oil and gas drilling in national parks and national wildlife refuges, without telling them that those policies were about to be reversed. Zinke, perhaps more than any other Cabinet secretary, reflects the Trump administrationâ€™s ambivalence about the operations of federal agencies and the people who work in them. He is quick to praise employees in public, at times tweeting out a â€œbravo zulu,â€ the Navy version of a  . But he also has held them up for public ridicule.

202248,110,secondary,104," Early on Wednesday, TMZ broke the news that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are divorcing. The response was immediate, and by and large followed the same template: This is not just the end of a marriage but the end of Brangelina"
202248,111,secondary,513,"   â€œThey are a portmanteau no more,â€ wrote Vulture. â€œBrangelina reduced to component parts,â€ wrote the A. V. Club. â€œBrangelina no more,â€ wrote CBC Canada"
202248,112,secondary,162,"Brangelina was a distinctive celebrity entity, one that for most of its life outshone its component parts. And now itâ€™s dead. Brangelina emerged from a classic    narrative Every celebrity has a carefully constructed image, one that reduces his or her public appeal to its simplest possible form. Jennifer Lawrence is a goofy cutup; Natalie Portman is a refined intellectual; Tom Hanks is Americaâ€™s dad. When Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie first announced their relationship in 2004, they were homewreckers"
202248,113,primary,98,"          Famously, when Pitt and Jolie became involved on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston. Anistonâ€™s image  â€”   with her iconic blond hair, her face familiar and lovable to every American who owned a TV after years of Friends  â€”   was and remains that of a classic â€œgirl next door. â€ When Pitt was married to Aniston, he was an   boy,   and unthreateningly handsome"
202248,114,primary,314,"           Jolie, in contrast, had a racier image. She used to wear a vial of Billy Bob Thorntonâ€™s blood around her neck. She once kissed her brother on the red carpet. If Aniston was Betty, Jolie was Veronica: sultry, a little dangerous, and somehow exotic"
202248,115,secondary,77,"      That    narrative has little to no basis in reality. We have absolutely no way of knowing what Aniston, Jolie, and Pitt are like in their private lives. But Anistonâ€™s public persona was sweet and accessible and Jolieâ€™s was sexy and dangerous, so that was the narrative that dominated discussion of Aniston and Pittâ€™s divorce and the beginning of Pitt and Jolieâ€™s relationship"
202248,116,secondary,541,"  Hence headlines like â€œHomewrecker Angelina Jolie Attacks Good Girl Jennifer Aniston!â€ Hence stories of an unhinged Aniston fan storming Jolieâ€™s dinner table and trying to slap her, screaming, â€œWhere is that homewrecking Angelina? !!â€ Hence comments on gossip forums like: â€œI happen think Angelia looks dirty and sleezy.. kissing her brother the way she did, yuck! .. wearing blood around her neck, something is just not right with that chick. Jen, who I donâ€™t think is drop dead gorgeous, just seems like a nice, wholesome, sweet girl.. â€ But then Pitt and Jolie changed the conversation. They created Brangelina. Brangelina put Pitt and Jolie in charge of the narrative As Anne Helen Petersen has chronicled for BuzzFeed, soon after Pitt and Jolie were first photographed frolicking together on a beach with Jolieâ€™s son Maddox, they began a public relations offensive"
202248,117,tertiary,204,   They did   global humanitarian outreach. Pitt visited AIDS orphanages in Ethiopia. Jolie won the United Nationsâ€™ Global Humanitarian Action Award. They traveled to Pakistan together to help with relief efforts after the earthquake
202248,118,primary,648,"          And as they did their global humanitarian work, they continually linked it to their growing, globalist family. They decided to deliver Shiloh in Namibia to draw attention to the country. They declared they wouldnâ€™t marry until   marriage was legal. They took their children with them to countries across the world"
202248,119,primary,186,"           This humanitarianism and family focus wasnâ€™t necessarily new or calculated  â€”   Jolie, for one, has a   history of working with refugees that goes back to 2002. But as Petersen points out, the focus of the PR campaign carried a message: â€œWhat they were saying was that this wasnâ€™t a story about sex or scandal; rather, it was one of family, humanitarianism, and global citizenship. â€ By the time they were done, Jolie and Pitt were no longer a scheming homewrecker and her hapless, feckless prey. No, they were Brangelina, a single celebrity unit that stood for happy modern families, for humanitarianism. And if the people who made up Brangelina happened to be beautiful, glamorous movie stars, that was just icing on the cake"
202248,120,primary,628,"           But what the advent of Brangelina meant was that Brad and Angelina werenâ€™t all that interesting on their own anymore. Instead, any story that had the potential to be about one of them got tweaked until it could be about both of them. So if you Google â€œBrad Pitt Oscar,â€ one of the first results speculates whether Pitt stores his statuette next to Jolieâ€™s in a domestic    awards setup"
202248,121,tertiary,457,"   And when Jolie announced in the New York Times that she would be getting a preventative double mastectomy, her   discussed how lucky she was â€œto have a partner, Brad Pitt, who is so loving and supportive. â€ The next day, Pitt released a statement calling her â€œheroic. â€ The story of Jolieâ€™s mastectomy became not just about a woman and her medical decision but about Brangelina and their family. â€œWe knew this was the right choice for our family,â€ Jolie wrote. Brangelina has subsumed its component parts. It has eclipsed them. There is no room for a narrative about Brad and Angelina as individuals; there is only room for Brangelina the unit. So itâ€™s entirely on brand that Jolieâ€™s lawyer says sheâ€™s filing for divorce â€œfor the health of the family. â€  As Brangelina enters its death throes, it still cares more about family than anything else.

180810,122,tertiary,26," A Boston jury on Friday found former New England Patriots football star Aaron Hernandez not guilty of murdering two men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012, following what prosecutors described as a dispute that began over a spilled drink. The decision comes two years after another Massachusetts jury found the former National Football League tight end guilty of murdering an acquaintance in an industrial park near his home in June 2013. He is currently serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for that killing. Except for a weapons possession count, Hernandez was found not guilty of all charges associated with the double murder, including witness intimidation. He was immediately sentenced to an additional four to five years in prison on the weapons conviction and led from the courtroom with tears streaking down his face. Gasps were heard from the gallery when the initial verdicts were read, and members of the victimsâ€™ families were led out of the courtroom, also in tears. â€What won this case was a dearth of evidence that connected Hernandez to these shootings,â€ Ron Sullivan, a member of his defense team, told reporters after the verdicts. Hernandez, now 27, was a rising star in the National Football League when he was arrested in 2013 and charged with murdering acquaintance Odin Lloyd"
180810,123,tertiary,557,"More than a year passed before he was charged with the   which prosecution witnesses said was the result of his paranoid temperament, which led him to constantly suspect people were disrespecting and challenging him. The jury heard from witnesses including a friend, Alexander Bradley, who said that he was in the car with Hernandez when the football star shot dead Cape Verdean nationals Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside the Boston nightclub. Defense lawyer Jose Baez, best known for successfully defending Florida mother Casey Anthony in the 2011 trial in which she was charged with murdering her daughter, relentlessly hammered Bradleyâ€™s credibility, suggesting that he had killed the men and pinned it on Hernandez in exchange for immunity. He pointed out holes in the prosecutionâ€™s case including the absence of forensic evidence tying Hernandez to the shootings   no fingerprints or DNA were found on the gun used in the killing or in the vehicle that Hernandez allegedly fired from. Baez contended that investigators focused on Hernandez as a suspect because of his fame, and disregarded evidence that pointed away from the NFL star, who had a $41 million contract at the time of his arrest. â€They donâ€™t want you to base your decision on evidence, they want you to base it on prejudice. They want you to say heâ€™s got tattoos, heâ€™s different than us. They want you to say heâ€™s a celebrity, heâ€™s different from us,â€ Baez told the jury in his closing argument. â€Thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re basing their case on.â€ Dan Conley, district attorney of Suffolk County, said the   verdicts showed the difficulty of solving a   shooting. â€Our theory of this case stands,â€ he told reporters, â€It points inescapably to Hernandez.â€  (Additional reporting by Valerie Vande Panne; editing by G Crosse, Bernard Orr) LONDON Having conquered the Paris clay with her   groundstrokes, Jelena Ostapenko plans to up the aggression further as she pursues her Wimbledon campaign.

217330,124,secondary,300,"         One of the best explanations of the Donald Trump 2016 phenomenon is this, via Salena Zito: â€The press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally.â€ But apparently some supporters took him both seriously and literally. And Trump, rather amazingly, is surprised by this. During his attempted victory lap in Indiana on Thursday celebrating the fact that Carrier opted to keep jobs in the state thanks to $7 million in incentives, Trump candidly admitted that he didnâ€™t even remember having promised to keep Carrierâ€™s jobs in the state and insisted that he hadnâ€™t actually meant to make that promise. He said his mention of keeping Carrierâ€™s jobs was meant to signify other manufacturing companies that might be tempted to move jobs outside the country  â€”   as Carrier long planned to do  â€”   in the future, and that he didnâ€™t even realize he had said it until he saw on the news that Carrierâ€™s workers expected him to make it happen. â€About a week ago, I was watching the nightly news,â€ Trump said, adding an obligatory dig at the media. â€But they were doing a story on Carrier. And I say, â€™Wow, thatâ€™s something. I want to see that. â€™â€ Trump recalled a â€handsomeâ€ employee who was interviewed for the piece who didnâ€™t seem worried about the companyâ€™s plans to move production to Mexico. â€He said something to the effect, â€™No weâ€™re not leaving, because Donald Trump promised us that weâ€™re not leaving,â€™â€ Trump said. â€And I never thought I made that promise  â€”   not with Carrier. I made it for everybody else. I didnâ€™t make it really for Carrier. And I said, â€™Whatâ€™s he saying? â€™â€ Trump went on: â€And they played my statement. I said, â€™Carrier will never leave.â€™ But that was a euphemism. I was talking about Carrier, like all other companies from here on in. Because they made the decision a year and a half ago. But he believed that that was  â€”   and I could understand it.â€ He was apparently referring to this Nov. 14 NBC Nightly News clip:   Carrier   became a rallying cry for Trump on the campaign trail. Now employees are counting on him to fulfill his promise. Watch @kevtibs. pic. twitter"
217330,125,tertiary,206," â€”   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) November 15, 2016   Here is the exact comment Trump made back in August: Weâ€™re bringing jobs back to our country. Weâ€™re not going to let Carrier leave. Hereâ€™s the thing: You can make an argument that Trump was perhaps speaking more generally and using Carrier as an example of the type of company that would no longer be leaving under his presidency. But this is a statement he made while in Indiana  â€”   in front of people who had a very strong interest in taking him literally. They did, and yet he was apparently surprised by that. Any studied politician would know that if you are in Indiana and you say Carrier wonâ€™t leave, you had better mean those exact words. That doesnâ€™t bode well for the hundreds of promises Trump has made that some highly interested stakeholders may have taken very seriously. Zitoâ€™s overall statement may hold true  â€”   that people read into Trump what they want and that they didnâ€™t take everything he said 100 percent literally. But for everyone who voted for Trump, you can bet thereâ€™s something they hope he was being very literal about  â€”   whether prosecuting Hillary Clinton, building a wall, taxing outsourcers (which Trump pledged to do yet again Thursday) or repealing Obamacare. Thereâ€™s quite simply no way Trump will ever fulfill all (or even most) of those promises, and perhaps his supporters will understand that. But many likely wonâ€™t.

179513,126,primary,46," Credit bureau Experian Plc has teamed up with technology firm Finicity to launch a new product aimed at speeding up the consumer lending process in the United States making it more digital. By using Finicityâ€™s technology, which aggregates data on accounts from thousands of banks and financial institutions, Experianâ€™s new service will give lenders   access to information on a customerâ€™s assets, income and ability to pay, the companies said. This means consumers will be able to apply for mortgages without having to provide reams of   verification documents during the underwriting process, the companies said. Instead they will only need to authorize lenders to view their account data, the companies said. They said the new service, set to launch on Monday, could reduce the underwriting process from as many as 70 days to up to 10 days. The launch reflects the growing pressure faced by banks and other    lenders to offer better digital services to their customers.

211686,130,secondary,381," President Obama is poised to declare the   national monument recognizing the struggle for gay rights, singling out a sliver of green space and part of the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood as the birthplace of Americaâ€™s modern gay liberation movement. While most national monuments have highlighted iconic wild landscapes or historic sites from centuries ago, this reflects the countryâ€™s diversity of terrain and peoples in a different vein: It would be the first national monument anchored by a dive bar and surrounded by a warren of narrow streets that long has been regarded the historic center of gay cultural life in New York City. Federal officials, including Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis and Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( . Y.) will hold a listening session on May 9 to solicit feedback on the proposal. Barring a   complication  â€”   city officials are still investigating the history of the land title  â€”   Obama is prepared to designate the area part of the National Park Service as soon as next month, which commemorates gay pride. Protests at the site, which lasted for six days, began in the early morning of June 28, 1969 after police raided the Stonewall Inn, which was frequented by gay men. While patrons of the bar, which is still in operation today in half of its original space, had complied in the past with these crackdowns, that time it sparked a spontaneous riot by bystanders and those who had been detained. Although national monument designations are partly symbolic, backers of the move said it could bolster the fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, which led to the landmark 2015 Supreme Court ruling legalizing   marriage"

211686,132,tertiary,343,"(US Department of the Interior)   â€œWe must ensure that we never forget the legacy of Stonewall, the history of discrimination against the LGBT community, or the impassioned individuals who have fought to overcome it,â€ Nadler, who has   legislation that would make it a national park, said in a statement. â€œThe LGBT civil rights movement launched at Stonewall is woven into American history, and it is time our National Park system reflected that reality. â€ The president described Stonewall as a critical event in the nationâ€™s social progress during his second inaugural speech, reflecting the idea â€œthat all of us are created equal,â€ and alluded to it again when celebrating the 50th anniversary of the march on Selma, Ala. Interior Department spokeswoman Amanda Degroff said Obama â€œhas made clear that heâ€™s committed to ensuring our national parks, monuments and public lands help Americans better understand the places and stories that make this nation greatâ€  â€”   though at the moment the administration has no official announcement on the designation. Noting that Jewell and Jarvis are attending next weekâ€™s public meeting at the invitation of Nadler and federal, state and local officials, Degroff added, â€œInsights from meetings like this one play an important role in identifying the best means to protect and manage significant sites like Christopher Park, whether a designation is established by Congress or through executive authority. â€ Nadler and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( . Y.) have asked the president to protect the site under the 1906 Antiquities Act. In a sign of how much has changed since 1969, the three officials who represent the area  â€”   City Council member Corey Johnson, state assembly member Deborah Glick and state senator Brad Hoylman  â€”   are all openly gay and endorse the idea of making it a monument, as does the local community advisory board. The decision to recognize a critical moment in the fight for gay rights, at a time when politicians in several states are moving to strip away legal protections for transgender, gay, lesbian and bisexual residents, enjoys considerable support within the administration. But the path to declaring the monument has been a complicated one, largely because the site involves private property and a dense urban area where   planning is never simple. But late last month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed legislation, backed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) and several state lawmakers, that would allow the city to transfer ownership of Christopher Park to the federal government should it become designated as a monument. That patch of green, spanning less than   of an acre, lies opposite the Stonewall Inn"

Gill Foundation president and chief executive Courtney Cuff, whose group helped fund a   study to identify what LGBT sites might qualify for National Park Service recognition, said a monument designation would mean â€œinterpreters will be talking to visitors about the LGBT community and the contributions of the LGBT movement writ large. â€ Hoylman, who lives in the neighborhood with his husband and    daughter Silvia, said he has taken her there and â€œtried to explain to her how important it is to her daddy and her papa. â€ â€œThe president has mentioned Stonewall along with Selma and Seneca Falls in his second inaugural.

208118,138,tertiary,299,"     The Facebook messaging group was at one point titled â€œHarvard memes for horny bourgeois teens. â€ It began when about 100 members of Harvard Collegeâ€™s incoming freshman class contacted each other through the universityâ€™s official Class of 2021 Facebook group. They created a messaging group where students could share memes about popular culture  â€”   a growing trend on the Internet among students at elite colleges. But then, the exchanges took a dark turn, according to an article published in the Harvard Crimson on Sunday. Some of the groupâ€™s members decided to form an offshoot group in which students could share obscene, â€œ â€ memes, a student told the Crimson. The founders of the messaging group demanded that students post provocative memes in the main group chat to gain admittance to the smaller group. The students in the spinoff group exchanged memes and images â€œmocking sexual assault, the Holocaust and the deaths of children,â€ sometimes directing jokes at specific ethnic or racial groups, the Crimson reported. One message â€œcalled the hypothetical hanging of a Mexican child â€˜piÃ±ata timeâ€™â€ while other messages quipped that â€œabusing children was sexually arousing,â€ according to images of the chat described by the Crimson. Then, university officials caught on. And in   after administrators discovered the offensive, racially charged meme exchanges, at least 10 incoming students who participated in the chat received letters informing them that their offers of admission had been revoked. In an email to The Washington Post Sunday night, Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman, said â€œwe do not comment publicly on the admissions status of individual applicants. â€ But according to the Harvard Crimson article, written by Harvard student Hannah Natanson, representatives from the admissions office emailed the implicated students asking them to reveal every picture they sent in the group. â€œThe Admissions Committee was disappointed to learn that several students in a private group chat for the Class of 2021 were sending messages that contained offensive messages and graphics,â€ read a copy of the Admissions Officeâ€™s email obtained by the Crimson. â€œAs we understand you were among the members contributing such material to this chat, we are asking that you submit a statement by tomorrow at noon to explain your contributions and actions for discussion with the Admissions Committee. â€ â€œIt is unfortunate that I have to reach out about this situation,â€ the email continued. According to Harvard college admissions policies, the university reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission if the admitted student â€œengages or has engaged in behavior that brings into question their honesty, maturity or moral character,â€ among other conditions, Dane told The Post. The Harvard College Class of 2021 official Facebook group  â€”   like similar groups for incoming students at other universities  â€”   allows admitted students to meet classmates, ask questions and prepare for their first semester. The group is managed by the Admissions and Financial Aid Office and states in its description it is â€œnot responsible for any unofficial groups, chats, or the content within. â€ â€œAs a reminder, Harvard College reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission under various conditions including if an admitted student engages in behavior that brings into question his or her honesty, maturity, or moral character,â€ the group description states. Cassandra Luca, an incoming student who joined the first meme group but not the second, told the Harvard Crimson the â€œdarkâ€ group chat was a â€œ      â€™   â€™   kind of thing. â€ Lucaâ€™s admission offer was not revoked, she told the student newspaper. This spring, 2, 056 students were invited to join Harvardâ€™s incoming freshman class, drawing from a record number of applications  â€”   39, 506, according to a university news release. Nearly 84 percent of the admitted students eventually chose to enroll at Harvard  â€”   the highest yield rate in several decades. The universityâ€™s decision to rescind the studentsâ€™ acceptance to Harvard underscores the dangers of social media posts  â€”   public or private  â€”   among prospective college students. According to Kaplan Test Prep, which surveyed more than 350 college admissions officers, 35 percent of admissions officers said they check social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to learn more about applicants. About 42 percent of those officials said what they found had a negative impact on prospective students. â€œFor better or worse, social media has become an established factor in college admissions, and itâ€™s more important than ever for applicants to make wise decisions,â€ Yariv Alpher, executive director of research at Kaplan Test Prep said. The repercussions spurred both praise and criticism from Harvard students, alumni and others at a time when university campuses across the country are in the midst of clashes over free speech. Some felt the decision was justified, while others expressed a belief that admissions officers crossed a line by judging students for their private conversations. Erica Goldberg, an assistant professor at Ohio Northern Law School who calls herself a â€œfree speech enthusiast,â€ wrote in a blog post that by â€œferreting outâ€ the members of the private chat group and revoking their acceptances Harvard â€œhas proven that there is an oppressive force to transgress. â€ Goldberg, who said she taught at Harvard Law School for three years, compared the dark humor used by the Harvard students to the popular â€œunabashedly irreverentâ€ game Cards Against Humanity, â€œwhose purpose is to be as cleverly offensive as possible. â€œEven many good liberals love the game, precisely because the humor is so wrong, so contrary to our values,â€ Goldberg wrote. She called on Harvard to reconsider its decision. â€œHarvard should not teach its students to be afraid to joke in private, among people willing to joke back,â€ Goldberg wrote. â€œHarvard should not teach students to turn on each other for speech. â€ This was not the first time Harvard administrators addressed controversial messages exchanged among incoming students. Last year, after connecting on the universityâ€™s official Facebook page for the Class of 2020, incoming students joined a private unofficial chat on the GroupMe messaging app. In it, some students exchanged images that included racially charged jokes and at least one message that mocked feminists.

215790,170,secondary,40,"     A specter is haunting professional football. The specter of simulated violence. For too long, weâ€™ve sat idly by while giant, hulking men simulated potentially violent acts during stoppages in play. Thatâ€™s not funny, and itâ€™s not right. No one goes to a sporting event to see violence  â€”   simulated or otherwise. Iâ€™m writing this now, of course, because Redskins cornerback Josh Norman was penalized last week for simulating    violence, and some barbaric enthusiasts   archery cultists disagreed with that call. They are under the mistaken impression that violence is okay. It is not. Look, Iâ€™ve seen my    daughter and her   friends play with bow and arrows. They even teach archery in her D. C. elementary school, blinded to the   possibilities of these devil tools. Merchants, if you can believe this, sell    sets in toy stores  â€”   and right in the very front, too. Kids read popular young adult novels that feature bows and arrows. So you donâ€™t need to tell me how much violence is implied by a    motion. You know how much happier I would be if my kid would stop with the    business and instead go out and play some sports, maybe take a few head shots from someone running at full speed? A lot happier, thatâ€™s how much.

Who could argue against a crackdown on mimicked violence?    (By Kim   Today Sports)  Violent acts are terrible things, even if theyâ€™re only mimicked"

Itâ€™s something that weâ€™re going to continue to try to be as consistent as possible. We certainly donâ€™t want our officials getting too specific with the announcement  â€”   we can have a little fun with that  â€”   but itâ€™s unsportsmanlike conduct. Itâ€™s an unsportsmanlike gesture, and thatâ€™s something that weâ€™ll continue to emphasize throughout the season. â€ Like others, I glanced through the rule book this week, to see the exact wording we can rely on to wipe out this plague of simulated violence. The passage comes at Rule 12 Section 3 Article 1( c) which clearly prohibits â€œusing baiting or taunting acts or words that engender ill will between teams. â€ The rule further notes that â€œThese acts include, but are not limited to: throat slash;   salute;   gestures; prolonged gyrations; or stomping on a team logo. â€   [Norman expected a warning, not a penalty, for    theatrics]   This is clear, concise and inarguable.

171839,179,tertiary,9,"Just southwest of bustling Charleston, S. C. lies a lush and rural gem called Wadmalaw Island, one of the Sea Islands that dot the shoreline. This is the home of the Charleston Tea Plantation, the only   commercial tea plantation in America. Here, 127 acres of gleaming dark green tea bushes unfold in endless rows, framed against   fields and silvery loops of Spanish moss that festoon the oak trees. With its sandy soils, subtropical climate and generous yearly rainfall of about 50 inches, Wadmalaw is an ideal home for tea. Rather than planting tea seeds, the Charleston Tea Plantation grows cuttings in a nursery for four years. The fledgling bushes are descendants of the same Camellia sinensis plants that were first brought to the Carolinas in the 1700s by French botanist Andre Michaux. The plantation is owned by the Bigelow Tea Co. in partnership with   tea taster William Barclay Hall, a fellow with a magnificent passion for tea and the knowledge to match it. I spoke with Hall about the tea business while sipping a cool cuppa and gazing out at the glimmering rows of tea plants flowing like green scarves to the horizon. Your grandfather and father were professional tea tasters. How did you become one, too? My father suggested I go into tea. Back then you had to have family connections to be trained. London was the center of the world trade in tea at the time, and every week teas were sent to London to be auctioned off. I tasted as many as 800 teas a day, five days a week. The goal was to be able to blind taste 10 teas and identify each oneâ€™s country and region of origin, and even the tea plant used"
171839,180,tertiary,11,"Were those many hundreds of cups of teas simply laid out for tasting?  About 80 were laid out at a time, on long benches. You would taste them all along with a buyer, then everything would be cleaned up and 80 more teas would be laid out. Though there is only one tea plant, Camellia sinensis, there are thousands of varieties. But they donâ€™t have names like Golden Delicious or Granny Smith  â€”   they have numbers. Believe it or not, all of the teas become individual to you. We have a special terminology for tea that . .. is hard to convey to an outsider. We might say, â€This tea has good character.â€ Well, what does character taste like? Or â€This tea is out of condition, that one is bright, that one is brisk, and this one is burnt.â€ Those descriptors are very important, because tea is one of the few commodities in the world bought and sold strictly on taste. And what makes teas so interesting, as opposed to, say, grapes, is that tea is harvested every   days. Grapes are harvested once a year  â€”   and you either have a good, bad or indifferent year. But tea is changing all the time. Is it too hot or cold this month? Is it the beginning, middle or end of the season? Did we have too much rain? All this influences the flavor of the tea. Tell us a little about how you grow the teas here. We donâ€™t use any pesticide, herbicides or fungicides. Tea is naturally pest resistant, because the caffeine and tannins repel insects. We use a custom irrigation system. We plant the bushes in long rows, very close together, with just enough space between the rows for the mechanical harvester to fit. That way, very little light filters down between the rows, and very few weeds or random tea seeds sprout. We dry the leaves on â€withering boxâ€ screens for 18 hours, then macerate them in a grinder. I then steep and taste and blend each batch until it tastes just right. You live on the property full time. How do you like it? What could be better than a life centered around tea? Nothing, absolutely nothing. People all over the world start and end their days with tea. Itâ€™s hardy, lives hundreds of years, requires no tilling of the soil and you can plant 5, 200   plants in every acre. Itâ€™s healthy for you. I love it here so much that I will eat everything out of my refrigerator, even down to my last jar of mayonnaise, before I leave the plantation and go to the city to shop for food.

180818,181,primary,526," Conservative candidate Francois Fillon is fighting to save his political career in Franceâ€™s presidential election after his campaign was hit by a fake jobs scandal. Once the clear favorite, Fillonâ€™s campaign was plunged into crisis when a satirical weekly reported in January that his wife, Penelope, had been paid hundreds of thousands of euros for doing little work, including several years as his parliamentary assistant. Fillon also paid two of their children for work as lawyers when he was a senator between 2005 and 2007"
180818,182,secondary,690,"The former prime minister has denied wrongdoing. But the affair and the combative way he reacted to it has undermined a wholesome image that Fillon, 63, a practicing Catholic with 36   years in politics, had cultivated. It also exposed him to allegations of hypocrisy since he proposes shock treatment for the French economy, including sharp cuts in public spending, cutting half a million public sector jobs and scrapping the   working week. Fillon sits behind   leader Marine Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron in the polls, but still nurses hopes of forcing his way into the May 7 runoff between the top two candidates in the April 23 first round. An admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Fillon is a social conservative who wants to limit adoption rights of gay couples. He has also called for warmer ties with Russia. A consummate political insider, Fillon has cast himself as the man to deliver the â€deep transformation, almost a revolutionâ€ he says France needs after years of slow growth under Socialist President Francois Hollande. â€My plan is the only one radical enough to get us out of the economic rut . ..,â€ he said in an   for Les Echos newspaper. Fillon fought on after magistrates put him under formal investigation over the fake jobs affair in March despite having said earlier that he would withdraw if that happened. Despite resignations by campaign aides and polls showing most voters wanted him to withdraw, Fillon resisted pressure from within his The Republicans party to step down. The fraud investigation was later widened to include luxury tailoring Fillon received as gifts, a judicial source said. Fillon fought back, alleging he was the victim of a government plot to destroy his candidacy by spreading damaging media leaks about him. He alleged the plot went right up to Hollande   an allegation denied by Hollandeâ€™s office. Fillon had pulled off an upset in the conservative primary, beating former president Nicolas Sarkozy and former prime minister Alain Juppe. Born in the Sarthe region some 200 km (125 miles) west of Paris, Fillon was the youngest member of parliament when first elected 36 years ago. Despite holding a variety of ministerial posts over the years, Fillon has generally kept a low profile. Sarkozy, who appointed Fillon as his prime minister from 2007 to 2012, once famously described him as effectively no more than a senior employee. Despite his mild, refined demeanor, Fillon showed his mettle as social affairs minister in 2003 when he faced down street protests over his retirement pension age reforms.

168455,192,tertiary,139,"Los Angeles is a city of extremes: There are neighborhoods so luxurious only millionaires can afford them and neighborhoods so poor that residents work several jobs to pay the rent. Now, a young LA painter is bringing these neighborhoods together on his canvases. Ramiro Gomez paints modernist houses in Beverly Hills, perfectly appointed kitchens and exclusive shops on Melrose Avenue. His pictures have nothing, and everything, to do with his background. Gomezâ€™s mother is a janitor, and his father works the graveyard shift driving a truck. Workers like his Mexican immigrant parents show up in his paintings  â€”   part of the invisible landscape of luxury LA. â€Someone will always be working to keep it nice,â€ Gomez says. â€Whether itâ€™s a home in the Hollywood Hills or Beverly Hills or the Paramount Studios.â€ Gomez puts those â€someonesâ€ on his canvases. He shows mostly Latino gardeners tending perfect lawns, maids cleaning tiles in gleaming bathrooms and nannies gathered in the park. These images show â€the lush, easy lifestyle of L. A. which is entirely undergirded by armies of domestic workers,â€ says New Yorker magazine writer Lawrence Weschler. Heâ€™s done a long essay on Gomez for the new coffee table book Domestic Scenes. The artist always has laborers in his range of sight, Weschler says. â€I can be walking along with him,â€ Weschler says. â€Heâ€™ll just say â€™Eight.â€™ Iâ€™ll say, â€™Eight what?â€™ He says, â€™Thereâ€™s eight workers I can see in my line of vision. Thereâ€™s that guy over there, thereâ€™s that guy, and that lady thatâ€™s there . ..â€™ â€ The first Gomez painting to catch Weschlerâ€™s eye was a nearly precise reproduction of a work by David Hockney. The famous English artist began painting rich LA in the 1960s. In A Bigger Splash, Hockney shows turquoise water in a big pool with a diving board and a big splash of water. (You can see it here.) In Gomezâ€™s version, the water darkens to cobalt and instead of a splash thereâ€™s a man cleaning the pool. Heâ€™s trawling for debris in the water. And over toward the back, a woman  â€”   sheâ€™s faceless, like all his figures  â€”   sweeps the patio near a wall of windows. Gomez calls it No Splash. â€The painting itself was originally going to be called Thursday Afternoon,â€ Gomez explains, â€because those are the times that the pool cleaner and the housekeeper would come into the space.â€ Gomez, who is 29, knows that from his years working as a nanny in LA in the expensive house where he worked he watched other servants come and go. Gomez does riffs on several Hockney paintings. He substitutes   gardeners for wealthy Hockney art collectors. He puts another gardener raking a grassy lawn that Hockney had shown being watered. Weschler has written extensively about Hockney and thought heâ€™d make an introduction. â€Next thing you know, weâ€™re driving up to the Hollywood hills up to Mulholland Drive through Laurel Canyon to meet him,â€ Gomez recalls. Weschler says Hockney was completely charmed and impressed by Gomez. â€He was excited to see these paintings in a different way,â€ Gomez says. â€He loved my choice of figures, he loved how I included the figures, he loved the color choices.â€ So, two generations after Hockneyâ€™s take on   in Los Angeles, a   shows unseen laborers, under those same sunny skies. Sometimes Gomez makes   cardboard cutouts of his workers, and stands them up on actual manicured lawns. â€Invariably the owner gets pissed off and removes the piece  â€”   or, more accurately  â€”   orders it removed by the help,â€ Weschler says. Gomez hopes the domestic workers do remove the cutouts  â€”   and take them home to keep. In addition to the paintings and cutouts, he rips pages from glossy magazines and applies his theme. In an ad for a shiny black Cadillac SUV, he includes people washing the car. Gomez denies heâ€™s a political painter, but Weschler says Gomez is â€wielding painting as a way of getting people to notice, and in some ways I think thatâ€™s one of the most political things you can do.â€ People are noticing and buying. In the past three years, California museums and private collectors have bought Gomez works, some for thousands of dollars. The grateful son of loving laborers was able to send his parents away for their first vacation. They spent a weekend at a nice hotel in Las Vegas. â€Now they understand that this little    that would draw on the wall, and a    that would stay after school in art studios, and the    that was painting in different materials, now to the    that is being featured in NPR and artwork and gallery shows  â€”   itâ€™s all part of my journey,â€ he says."
207647,193,primary,27,"     A current, senior White House adviser  â€”   not merely another former campaign aide or distant associate of President Trump  â€”   has been identified by federal investigators as a significant person of interest in a probe aimed at determining whether Trumpâ€™s political team colluded with Russia to meddle in the 2016 election. Let that sink in"
207647,194,primary,75," [Russia probe reaches current White House official, people familiar with the case say]   Among many things, the focus on someone close to the president means that the firewall protecting him from the full heat of media scrutiny is crumbling. Though he complained this week that â€œno politician in history . . . has been treated worse or more unfairly,â€ the reality is that Trump has been somewhat insulated by journalistsâ€™ inability to show that the FBI investigation touches him or anyone on his White House staff directly. Trump has insisted that he is not in the FBIâ€™s crosshairs, claiming last week that the agencyâ€™s   James B. Comey, told him on three occasions that he is not a target. And the White House has attempted to distance itself from known targets such as Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Carter Page"
207647,195,tertiary,102,"     The law enforcement investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign has identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest. (The Washington Post)   At one point, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that Manafort, who chaired Trumpâ€™s campaign before being replaced by Kellyanne Conway, â€œplayed a very limited role for a very limited amount of time. â€ Laughable as that assertion was, the press has felt obligated to exercise dual restraint: It is possible that any contacts between campaign officials and Russians were not part of a coordinated effort to collect and disseminate damaging information about Hillary Clinton. And it is possible that even if there was collusion, it happened without Trumpâ€™s knowledge. Both possibilities are still, well, possible. But in the context of the FBI investigation, the separation between Trump and those working on his behalf is shrinking as the probe pushes nearer to his inner circle. Though it is too early to know what the FBI will conclude, the attention on someone Trump continues to lean on as president would appear to increase the likelihood that if collusion occurred, he might have been aware of it. In the simplest terms, there is a big difference between headlines that say â€œone of the presidentâ€™s senior advisers is under investigationâ€ and headlines that say â€œsome people who used to work for candidate Trump are under investigation. â€ Trump now enters a new phase in which the focus of press coverage will sharpen. Many stories have been written about his failure to vet staffers more thoroughly. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Trumpâ€™s team knew Michael Flynn was the subject of a separate FBI investigation yet still named him national security adviser, making the presidentâ€™s judgment all the more questionable. It is getting harder and harder to give Trump the benefit of the doubt  â€”   to continue attributing his hiring of people who draw FBI scrutiny to innocent carelessness. Expect the White House to confront more aggressive inquiries about whether Trump knew what his staffers might have been up to."
198613,196,secondary,745," Silicon Valley philosopher king Paul Grahamâ€™s essay on inequality has set tech Twitter on fire for the past few days. Itâ€™s about as intensely loved and hated as any piece on the topic I can remember. Which makes sense, because it manages to jam some very good points together with some very bad ones"
198613,197,tertiary,649,"  Graham, a famed adviser to technology startups, appears to have experienced the inequality conversation as an attack on his lifeâ€™s work. His essay is thus more a defense of startups and their worth than it is an analysis of the trends driving inequality. More than anything, Graham seems terrified of policies that, in trying to combat inequality, would end up targeting the founders of tech companies. This is a slightly bizarre interpretation of the debate. The inequality argument has emerged at a moment when Silicon Valley startups are lionized but protesters take to the streets to demand the dissolution of Goldman Sachs. If inequality were driven by technology startups, there would be much less concern over it. But Grahamâ€™s focus on startups as a cause and consequence of inequality is also empirically wrong. â€Startups are almost entirely a product of this period [of inequality],â€ he writes, which is simply not true. For all the Silicon Valley hype, the startup rate has actually been declining as inequality has been rising"
198613,198,primary,16,"             In a separate (and, I think, more interesting and nuanced) essay, Graham argues that in the   century, there were startups, but they were very different in composition. â€Educated people,â€ he writes, worked for large corporations, because â€there was practically zero concept of starting what we now call a startup: a business that starts small and grows big.â€    So perhaps that falling startup rate obscures a rise in the kind of startups that interest Graham. Even if thatâ€™s true  â€”   Graham doesnâ€™t present data to prove it, but it certainly seems correct as a description of Silicon Valley trends   â€”   it doesnâ€™t change the fact that there is no observable relationship nationally in recent decades between the rate of startup formation and inequality. I wonder whether Grahamâ€™s perch in Silicon Valley isnâ€™t warping his analysis of whatâ€™s going on in the rest of the economy. Thereâ€™s a reason it was called Occupy Wall Street rather than Occupy Google When you dig into the occupations of the top 0. 1 percent, you find that â€the incomes of executives, managers, supervisors, and financial professionals can account for 60 percent of the increase in the share of national income going to the top percentile of the income distribution between 1979 and 2005.â€    Some of that is certainly Silicon Valley executives. But itâ€™s the financial professionals that this conversation is really about. You can see that in the timing. The debate over inequality doesnâ€™t coincide with either the rise of Silicon Valley (late â€™90s, and then again in the early 2000s) or even the rise of income inequality (1980s). It coincides with the aftermath of the Great Recession  â€”   a time when finance professionals crashed the global economy, immiserated millions of people, and managed to remain incredibly, infuriatingly rich. Thereâ€™s a reason it was called Occupy Wall Street rather than Occupy Google"
198613,199,secondary,429,"          By the time of the 2007 crash, financial sector profits accounted for about 35 percent of all corporate profits. These werenâ€™t startups. Indeed, the fear in the financial sector was over firms so ridiculously large that the government wouldnâ€™t permit them to fail"
198613,200,tertiary,831,"  â€I know the rich arenâ€™t all getting richer simply from some sinister new system for transferring wealth to them from everyone else,â€ Graham writes. In Silicon Valley, thatâ€™s largely true. But if you lost your construction job because of the financial crisis even as a trader who bet on subprime bonds kept both his career and his bonuses, youâ€™ve got good reason to think the rich are getting richer from a rigged system. Graham tries to acknowledge this in a footnote. â€Others will say Iâ€™m clueless or being misleading by focusing on people who get rich by creating wealth that startups arenâ€™t the problem, but corrupt practices in finance, healthcare, and so on. Once again, that is exactly my point. The problem is not economic inequality, but those specific abuses.â€ But this gets almost tautological. The inequality debate is driven by the belief that those kinds of abuses are disparate and widespread. People need a way to talk about the idea that economic gains are being shared unfairly and inequality is the word theyâ€™ve chosen to do it. Dismissing the source of their anger only leads you to miss the point of their critique"
198613,201,primary,557,"Sweden has more startups and less inequality than America An important point Graham makes is that while people are angry about income inequality, they usually prioritize fixing other problems. When it comes down to it, they really care about poverty, or social mobility, or median wages, or political power. Consider two worlds. In one, the Gini coefficient  â€”   the standard measure of inequality  â€”   remains the same, but median wages are double their current level. In another, the Gini coefficient falls, but median wages are 10 percent lower and poverty is 3 percentage points higher. Would anyone choose the second world? Bueller? But having made that point, Graham spends much of his essay grappling with strawmen. Statements like â€Ending economic inequality would mean ending startupsâ€ confuse the conversation. No one is talking about ending startups. No one is even talking about ending inequality. And you can certainly ameliorate inequality without destroying the ability to found new companies. Sweden, for instance, has a higher startup rate than America, and less income inequality  â€”   as do a number of other countries"
198613,202,secondary,183,"  No particular level of inequality is inevitable Grahamâ€™s belief that you canâ€™t ease inequality without declaring war on technology runs deep. â€I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries that donâ€™t choose something worse,â€ he writes. He argues that the long fall in inequality in the 20th century was an anomaly driven by wars and   oligopolies. He goes on to write:  The acceleration of productivity we see in Silicon Valley has been happening for thousands of years. If you look at the history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating in the Mesolithic. The acceleration would have been too slow to perceive in one lifetime. Such is the nature of the leftmost part of an exponential curve. But it was the same curve. You do not want to design your society in a way thatâ€™s incompatible with this curve. The evolution of technology is one of the most powerful forces in history"
198613,203,primary,532,"This is far too fatalistic. Modern societies have long figured out how to manage this curve. Technology makes individuals grow more productive, in part because they stand atop the knowledge and industrial base of their societies, and societies redistribute part of that wealth, in part because thatâ€™s necessary to sustain the political stability and economic freedom required to protect those individuals. There are difficulties and   inside this system, but theyâ€™re manageable, and all in all, it actually works pretty well. The taxes the Silicon Valley elite pay in the 21st century are much, much higher than anything their predecessors paid in the 18th century, but somehow people still like inventing new things and getting rich. Thereâ€™s no particular level of inequality that is inevitable, and itâ€™s both pessimistic and ahistorical  â€”   two qualities I donâ€™t tend to associate with Graham, who tends towards optimism and a strong grasp of history  â€”   to believe the drive towards technological progress is so flimsy that modest changes to the tax code or social programs will derail it.

152674,204,primary,483,"Islamic Stateâ€™s doctrine of survival is based on a simple notion: defeat on the battlefield must always leave behind the seeds for a comeback. Whether the operation to retake Mosul will be the beginning of the end for Isis or the beginning of a new cycle hinges largely on understanding this basic fact. The security and political vacuum in Mosul will be the likely seed that could enable an Isis regeneration. Unless the government in Iraq allows a situation in which local Sunnis fill the void, a new cycle is almost certain. That much seems to be accepted by Iraqi and American planners directly involved in the effort to dislodge Isis from its most populous and prestigious stronghold. The current strategy stipulates that Shia and Kurdish militias will not fight inside the city, a way to reduce local concerns about political ambitions. The question, though, is who will fill the void? Can the government in Baghdad empower a Sunni alternative to isolate Isis? Even if Baghdad has the desire and the ability to do so, who is this alternative? The northern parts of Iraq stretching from Anbar to Nineveh are a microcosm of the problems that plagued the country for a decade. Isis was able to emerge out of the ashes in 2014 but the country is significantly more fractured today than when the group was driven out of the urban centres in 2007. Deeper wounds have opened over the past two years and many sectarian, ethnic and political stakeholders are vying for influence in this particular region of Iraq. Yet there is cause for guarded optimism amid todayâ€™s bleak landscape. The battle for Mosul is so far led by professional Iraqi forces, which include thousands of local Sunni fighters keen to retake their areas from Isis. New dynamics have emerged since Isis seized Mosul more than two years ago. Some of the changes present historic opportunities for the government in Baghdad to redraw the social contract, while others will serve as disrupters to any such effort. These changes include the reconfiguration of the Sunni divide in the country into three broad categories. The first includes the insiders who have worked closely with   forces battling Isis in their areas. They tend to focus on rebuilding their own homes and see merits in a government presence that prevents the return of a vile militia that caused the destruction. Second are the politicians already part of the government in Baghdad. They have little leverage over their communities, but some believe in pushing for change through political engagement. The politiciansâ€™ ability to fill the void in Sunni areas is minimal. They are often busy fighting each other rather than working together to help their communities. Political rejectionists form the third category. They dismiss the existing political order as inherently disadvantageous to Sunnis. They perceive the government in Baghdad as beholden to Iran, and the only way out is an overhaul of Iraqi politics. Any Iranian influence in the country is viewed with profound suspicion. When Isis took over a third of Iraq in 2014, some of this group welcomed the insurgents but many gambled on the development to reverse the political situation in the country for ever. Rejectionists might not have direct influence in their communities, but they have the ability to undermine any Sunni political engagement. Similarly, many Shia politicians and militants believe that they should be exempted from any outreach effort. Even politicians in Baghdad who have called for an end to the old game of authoritarian and sectarian Nouri   the former prime minister, indicated that Baghdad has no place for such individuals after they have lost their bet. Conflict between the rejectionists and Baghdad will likely worsen, unless the current thinking of both sides changes. But the common denominator between the three Sunni categories is local governance. The ability of Sunnis to govern their localities will resolve, with time, much of the political stagnation in the country. Maliki, whose policies directly enabled the rise of Isis in 2014, opposed the empowerment of local actors to rule their areas. Today the stakes are even higher than before. Only if the old way of Maliki is replaced with a true desire to strengthen Sunnis to fill the void in their towns can Iraq be sure to end the cycle.

191081,205,secondary,299," President Barack Obama formally announced the lifting of U. S. sanctions on Myanmar on Friday by terminating an emergency order that deemed the policies of the former military government a threat to U. S. national security. â€I have determined that the situation that gave rise to the national emergency . .. has been significantly altered by Burmaâ€™s (Myanmarâ€™s) substantial advances to promote democracy, including historic elections in November 2015,â€ Obama said in a letter to the U. S. House and Senate speakers. A U. S. Treasury statement said that as a result of the termination of the emergency order the economic and financial sanctions administered by the Department of the Treasuryâ€™s Office of Foreign Assets Control were no longer in effect. The move followed a meeting between Myanmarâ€™s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Obama in Washington last month, when she called for the lifting of economic sanctions against her country, and he said he was willing to do this. Suu Kyiâ€™s National League for Democracy won a sweeping victory in the November elections. Obamaâ€™s letter pointed to the formation of a democratically elected,   government as a result of the election, the release of many political prisoners and improved human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and freedom of association and peaceful assembly. â€While Burma faces significant challenges, including the consolidation of its democracy, the United States can, and intends to, use other means to support the government and people of Burma in their efforts to address these challenges,â€ Obamaâ€™s letter said. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and democracy icon, helped persuade the West to impose sanctions on Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, during her years as a jailed opposition leader. She is now trying to strike a balance between showing her people the economic rewards of a democratic transition while keeping pressure on the countryâ€™s generals for further reforms"

The prospect of Trump winning the Republican primary had been the stuff of Washington jokes, whispered hallway conversations and   even as he led in public opinion polls for months and dominated debate after debate. But with the brash billionaire now winning three straight contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, denial is giving way to a mostly gloomy acceptance that he may have too much momentum to be stopped, especially if wins big in key Southern primaries next week that look favorable to him. â€It fills all of us with concern and dread,â€ said Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has endorsed fellow Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, considered the main hope of the Republican establishment to derail Trumpâ€™s march to the nomination.

186721,221,primary,218,"â€But I think what you find is that, you know, politics as usual in Washington, D. C. is not something that the American people want,â€ he said. Lewandowski added that voters â€sent a very clear messageâ€ in the three early voting states where Trump won nominating contests â€that they want someone who is going to make fundamental change. â€ Asked if Trumpâ€™s campaign would work harder to win establishment endorsements as he got closer to the nomination, Lewandowski pointed to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, an early establishment favorite who quit the race on Saturday. â€If endorsements mattered,â€ he said, â€Jeb Bush would be the nominee.â€  (Reporting by Susan Cornwell, Richard Cowan, Kevin Drawbaugh, Jason Lange, Arshad Mohammed, David Morgan, James Oliphant,  Matt Spetalnick and Emily Stephenson; Writing by James Oliphant; Editing by Stuart Grudgings and Frances Kerry) This article was funded in part by SAP.

202015,235,secondary,698," Itâ€™s true: The next iPhone wonâ€™t have a headphone jack. Apple just made the announcement at an event in San Francisco. While the rumored change has been debated for months in the tech media, itâ€™s still going to come as a shock to millions of ordinary iPhone users who canâ€™t imagine life without the ubiquitous 3. 5 mm headphone jack"
202015,236,tertiary,68,"  While many people will grumble about the change, Apple argues that it will actually make users better off in the long run. On the one hand, removing the headphone jack is another step in Appleâ€™s relentless campaign to make each iPhone thinner, lighter, and more durable than the last. On the other hand, Apple argues that digital alternatives  â€”   either wireless Bluetooth headphones or headphones connected to the iPhoneâ€™s remaining Lightning port  â€”   actually deliver superior sound quality. The new iPhone 7 wonâ€™t look all that different from its predecessor, the iPhone 6. But it will have some significant feature upgrades. The larger model will add a second camera to the back of the device. By taking two photos simultaneously, the latest iPhone will be able to take crisper, clearer pictures as well as perform novel tricks like tweaking the focus of a picture. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with two cameras on the back Apple says the new camera is even more powerful than the already good camera in the iPhone 6. According to Apple, the iPhone 7 captures richer colors, works better in   situations, and has more sophisticated chips that improve image quality"
202015,237,tertiary,554,"  Most importantly, the larger version of the iPhone  â€”   the iPhone 7 Plus  â€”   comes with two cameras side by side. One has a   lens, while the other has a telephoto lens. The result: The telephoto lens allows users to zoom in by a factor of two without sacrificing image quality. Finally, the iPhone 7 Plus uses the pair of cameras to detect the depth of objects in a picture, much as the human brain does. That allows the camera to produce an advanced effect called â€depth of field,â€ in which a foreground image is in focus while the background is blurry. The iPhone 7 gives you three options for headphones If you buy an iPhone 7, you wonâ€™t be able to just plug a headphone jack into it like you can with an iPhone 6. What are you supposed to do instead? Apple offers three options:     You can buy a     adapter, allowing you to plug an   pair of headphones  â€”   or any other audio device that uses the standard headphone jack  â€”   into your iPhone 7. The obvious downside here is that you have to carry around an extra adapter. You can use wireless headphones based on the Bluetooth standard. This standard is supported by all recent iPhones, so products already on the market should work with the iPhone 7. The big downside here is that wireless headphones have batteries that need to be recharged. Recharging headphones is an extra hassle, and the greater complexity of Bluetooth headphones also mean they tend to cost more, which is bad news for people with a habit of losing them. You can use wired headphones based on the Lightning standard. Apple will bundle a pair of these with the iPhone 7, and there are a few other options on the market already. But, as Iâ€™ve already mentioned, theyâ€™re pricey, with earbuds starting around $50 and larger headphones costing much more. Expect the options here to improve over the next year as third parties cash in on the bonanza of iPhone 7 users looking for   headphones"

165590,239,primary,556,"When it comes to comedy, Late Night host Seth Meyers is clear about what drew him in: â€I got into it because it looked like the most fun job in the world,â€ he says. â€And it has not led me astray.â€ Indeed, Meyersâ€™ resume is packed with fun. Before taking over the reins at Late Night, he spent 13 years at Saturday Night Live, first as a performer, then as head writer and the   alongside Amy Poehler, of the showâ€™s â€Weekend Updateâ€ segment. But both writing and working in front of a live audience each week on SNL was not without its drawbacks. Meyers recalls ruminating over shows that didnâ€™t quite hit the mark: â€If you had a bad SNL, it stayed with you all week,â€ he says. Now, as host of his own nightly show, Meyers actively works against the instinct to second guess himself. â€We made this decision after [Late Night] every night not to do a   . .. [and] instead [to] sleep on it,â€ he says. â€And if itâ€™s still bothering you in the morning, letâ€™s talk then. The reality is, you are then just focused on the next show. . .. Itâ€™s nice to be in this place where you can be very forward focused.â€ On late night comedy in the Trump era, People say, Oh you are doing the job of journalists. We canâ€™t do our job without journalists. Journalists can do their job without late night comedians theyâ€™d be just fine without us. But we, of course, use their work every day to build our pieces. . .. I think weâ€™re all lucky as a society that journalists are trying to hold this standard and hold this line of what it means to be a journalist, and the integrity that it means to be a journalist. Whereas comedians are built for the Donald Trump era, because we comedians notoriously have very low levels of integrity. On making fun of Donald Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner  I saw him three days after, and we were at an event in New York. . .. The reason that I found him to be such a fair target that night [of the dinner] was the birther issue  â€”   that was what he was loudly championing at the time, which I still, to this day, find to be one of his more disgraceful things heâ€™s ever done. So I wasnâ€™t just bullying for the sake of bullying. I thought he was, and continue to think heâ€™s a bully. Lorne Michaels, [creator and executor producer of SNL] one of the things heâ€™d always say to you is: Donâ€™t tell a joke about somebody where, if you saw them, you would feel you had to leave the room. Be decent enough, if itâ€™s fair enough and you believe in it, you shouldnâ€™t have to leave the room. And so I saw him and I walked over and I said, â€Hey, I just wanted to thank you for being a good sport the other night.â€ Even though he hadnâ€™t been and he had already criticized me. I wanted to give him the chance to have some revisionist history with me. And he did not, and he said: â€You were very rude. It was too far, the president was funny. You were too rude.â€ And I said, â€Well, itâ€™s good seeing you.â€ But then we ran into each other at the SNL 40th, which I would say [was] maybe only about four months before he announced [his candidacy]. . .. It was very crowded, and that studio is very small and I realized  â€”   I was with my wife  â€”   and I realized we are going to cross in an aisle getting to our seats. . .. He and I actually had a very lovely bygones be bygones interaction then, and I think we would be in a perfectly fine place had he not decided to run and win president. On getting his start in comedy, My father to this day is the funniest person I know. And he was the funniest person anybody who knew him knew. And when he started laughing at me, when I could make him laugh, I had the sense of, Oh I might be good at this. And also, my parents, at a very inappropriate age, introduced us to things like SNL and Monty Python, and it was stuff I just loved and was delighted by. And I went off to college and I hadnâ€™t really done much comedy stuff, but I went to Northwestern University . .. and they had a really good improv troupe and I saw it [during] â€  weekâ€ my freshman year, and I had a real sense of . .. I think I can get onstage with other really funny people and come up with things off the top of my head"
165590,240,secondary,288,"On being hired at SNL as a performer in 2001, I was hired as a performer and then they course corrected. [Becoming a staff writer] took about five years, and those were my hardest five years on the show. I thought when you showed up at SNL, that meant you were as good as everybody at SNL. Like how could Lorne be wrong? And you walk down the hallway . .. thereâ€™s everybodyâ€™s first head shot. And your first few weeks there, you just see all the people that are super famous and you realize thatâ€™s your next chapter: Oh Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Will Ferrell, Iâ€™m on that path. And then, about three months in, you start looking at the people who were there only a year, and youâ€™re like, Oh no, maybe Iâ€™m gonna be that person. I was really afraid I would be fired. On getting the phone call from SNL that they might not renew his contract  Two years in, and this happens, you basically get a call where theyâ€™re like, â€Weâ€™re supposed to pick up your contract this day [but] weâ€™re gonna wait another month.â€ [Theyâ€™re] basically saying, Weâ€™re gonna see what else is out there before we make a decision. I did get that call, and that is an awful way to spend a month in the summer. . .. It was really bad, and the other thing that was really bad, and this is something that was my own shame and something that I did not find attractive in myself: The people that came after me were some of the great performers I think of this generation. Fred Armisen came, Will Forte, and then Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis, and Andy Samberg. And these were people that I was in competition with, and they were my friends. And I felt great jealousy towards them and their successes  â€”   which was an awful thing to feel. And so I was kind of saved by the fact that Lorne offered me this position on the writing staff, and then I felt at home. It was the first time that I felt like I was adding value as opposed to keeping space warm. On how hosting Late Night has changed his life, It is strange, because I do walk into the same building, it is on the same floor as Saturday Night Live, so there are parts of my life that are very similar I did not have to move to a different place or a new elevator bank. But there is this lovely consistency to a job that is the same hours every day and the same schedule everyday. And also at SNL, they call the guests â€hostsâ€ for a reason, because they completely take over the DNA of [the show] that week. Whereas your own show, you are the host, because the guests ultimately donâ€™t change the show that much. . .. Itâ€™s nice to be in a place that is more consistent. That is the part I enjoy the most. On the best parts of working in comedy, It was a chance to work with people who are really funny, which has been the greatest gift of this life. . .. I loved sports and was terrible at sports, and I never once in my life did anything on any field of play that gave me that adrenaline rush of success. But I do feel that when you write something or when you tell a joke that works really well itâ€™s the greatest feeling on Earth. I am chasing it because it makes me feel good, Iâ€™m not trying to cloak anything that feels bad.

165105,241,tertiary,45,"Pankaj Rayamajhi hears something. Senioritis? The director of school logistics and operations has a kind of sixth sense about that unique Spring affliction as he roams the hallways of Columbia Heights Education Campus, a public middle and high school in Washington, D. C. Rayamajhi quickens his pace,   in hand, and turns a corner into a stairwell. Yep, senioritis. When they see him, the small group of students loitering on the stairs scatters back to class. â€Right outside Whitakerâ€™s room there are some students here probably cutting class,â€ he says into his   radio to a security guard. â€Can you please make sure these hallways are clear?â€ â€Copy that.â€ Itâ€™s just one of a hundred fires small and large the burly   school administrator will handle on this day, tasks that in years past would have likely been handled by the principal. We like to think of school principals, at their best, as instructional leaders with a laser focus on boosting student achievement, school culture and academic accountability. But too often principals and their deputies have to deal with hundreds of things that have little to do directly with teaching and learning: student discipline, school maintenance, the cafeteria, safety, transportation, paperwork  â€”   and lots more. The District of Columbia Public Schools is taking a national lead in trying to change that by adding directors of operations and logistics. The idea is to liberate principals to focus more on teaching evaluation, planning and assessment and far less on milk, leaky faucets or security. Rayamajhi oversees a daunting list of daily needs, from maintenance and security to procurement and HR. Part logistician, part disciplinarian as well as coach and security guard, he roams the hallways and lunch rooms,   and talking to everyone, including the nearly 50 employees he manages. If a teacher or teacherâ€™s aide needs something, they come to Pankaj, as heâ€™s known. â€Be it a teacher saying, â€™Oh, my ACâ€™s not working and my sinkâ€™s cloggedâ€™ to a student survey that needs to be done in the next two weeks,â€ he says. â€Itâ€™s been an immense help,â€ says Maria Tukeva, principal at the   Columbia Heights Education Campus, and the cityâ€™s   principal. â€I was worrying about whether there was soap in the bathroom or there was toilet paper in the bathroom.â€ These things are important, and urgent, Tukeva says. â€However, I also have to worry about is everyone learning how to read at a high level, is everyone learning math at a high level.â€ What began in D. C. in 2014 as a small pilot project has now spread to 70 of the cityâ€™s 115 public schools. Lots of research shows the vital link between school leadership and student success. But many principals say their daily   lists eat up valuable time they could better use to focus on instruction, motivation and innovation. Tukeva says having Rayamajhi has helped free her and her staff to spend more time on instructional feedback and professional development. â€To do an excellent job, principals and assistant principals need to spend the majority of their time in the classrooms and with teachers and in planning curriculum,â€ she says, â€all those things that go into a strong instructional program.â€ Chief operations officer? Rayamajhi has had to handle everything from rescuing a janitor stuck in a broken elevator at 11 p. m. to settling a studentâ€™s family problem by calling his uncle in Guatemala. He also oversees the schoolâ€™s five daily lunch sessions. Food for 1, 400 in a small time window. What could go wrong? â€This is where the magic happens,â€ he says amid a cacophony of student jostling and noise. â€This is organized chaos.â€ On this day, he quickly confiscates a basketball from a student dribbler. â€You know the rules, man,â€ he tells him. â€Pull up your pants please, sir,â€ he shouts to a   sophomore nearby. Also on Rayamajhiâ€™s   list: school registration. And transportation issues. Oh, and donâ€™t forget customer service for several dozen parents who come into the office daily, as well as the regular evening and weekend events at the school. His list seems endless. â€Field trips. Thatâ€™s all me. I have to get the buses,â€ he says with a smile. I ask him if he sees himself as a kind of the chief operating officer. â€Thatâ€™s one way of putting it, yes,â€ he says. â€It is a lot but it takes all of these off the principal and assistant principals so they can focus mostly on the classroom. Hey, whereâ€™s your uniform, man?â€ he asks a student not wearing the required blue top. His day starts with a text or call at 6 a. m. from the schoolâ€™s lead maintenance man, Christopher Best, giving the physical plant update and  . Best, a 12 year veteran of the place, says things improved under Rayamajhiâ€™s stewardship. â€I report directly to him. Let him know whatâ€™s going on for the day instead of burdening the principal. Sheâ€™s already got her plate full,â€ Best says. â€Going through him is a lot smoother.â€ An idea whose time has come? The duties of the American school principal have not fundamentally changed all that much in the last century. Few districts today have an operations chief to oversee and coordinate the majority of   work. In many traditional public schools, it still falls on the principal and assistant principal to oversee learning as well as â€all of those logistical and managerial tasks that are supporting student learning,â€ says Bob Farrace, director of public affairs for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, or NASSP. Farrace says NASSP does not track or have any data on which districts in the U. S. have added operations managers. But the practice is not widespread and confined mostly to large urban districts, Farrace says. â€Itâ€™s the rare principal that doesnâ€™t need more support with administrative tasks,â€ he says, â€but that doesnâ€™t mean the principal is going to abdicate duties for those things.â€ Farrace argues that creating an ops or logistics manager simply isnâ€™t practical   for many districts, especially smaller and rural ones. â€These are the principals that are   instructional leaders, and coaching baseball and driving the bus in the morning.â€ The practice is common, however, in many charter schools. In fact, the D. C. schools hired Doug Hollis, a school operations expert, from a city charter school in 2014 to run a pilot project with nine schools. Hollis now manages the expanding program. Itâ€™s not just liberation from toilets, soap, milk and buses. Columbia Heights Principal Tukeva says now she and her deputy principals no longer have to deal with streams of paperwork for hiring, procurement or registration. Most of all, she says, they can better focus on academic and   planning and the vital work of observing teachers, with coaching and   on classroom methods and following student assessments. â€And then working with teacher teams to see how these results should be used to adjust instruction.â€ DCPS officials say itâ€™s too soon to tell. But the hope is the program helps boost student achievement, saves money and improves efficiency. The District aims to add more directors of operations and logistics to more of the cityâ€™s schools over the next few years. â€Corporations, they all have a director of operations, a chief operational officer. So this is definitely something that we need on a permanent basis in all schools,â€ Tukeva says. Back in the hallway, Rayamajhi speaks firmly yet politely into his   readying for another chaotic lunch shift. â€OK, all security letâ€™s get ready for first lunch please. All security, letâ€™s get ready for first lunch!â€"
198862,242,primary,386," The Iowa caucuses are 10 days away, so naturally everyone is talking about   â€¦     Bernie Sandersâ€™s position on reparations?    This week, a controversy has arisen around Sandersâ€™s recent statement that he does not support reparations for black Americans  â€”   payments to compensate for centuries of US policies that oppressed black people  â€”   partly because he doesnâ€™t think they could ever be enacted. This strikes some as hypocritical because Sanders, a   democratic socialist, supports many policies that seem just as politically unrealistic, like   health care. The critics in some ways misunderstand Sandersâ€™s views on this issue. Itâ€™s not solely that he thinks reparations are too politically unrealistic, but also that he believes theyâ€™d be too divisive. That word  â€”   divisive  â€”   is key, because so much of Sandersâ€™s campaign is built on starting a political revolution that will unite the country, including the white working class, against the wealthy and powerful. Nonetheless, the reparations spat helps demonstrate what his critics and even some of his supporters have consistently called a blind spot in his campaign: racial issues. From that perspective, the reparations controversy isnâ€™t really over whether Sanders should come out in favor of reparations, but rather why heâ€™s consistently perceived as stumbling when it comes to race  â€”   especially when, as the liberal candidate in the race, he should have a stronger position on this big issue in the Democratic primary"
198862,243,primary,457,"  Still, this is definitely an unexpected place for the Democratic presidential campaign to be in  â€”   especially because the reparations issue doesnâ€™t even divide the candidates, since Hillary Clinton opposes them, too. So letâ€™s start with how we got here"
198862,244,secondary,253,"  How reparations became a Democratic campaign issue  This latest chapter of the Democratic campaign began on January 13, after Nando Vila at Fusion asked Sanders if he backs reparations for slavery. Sanders said:  No, I donâ€™t think so. First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. I think the real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the   community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the   community, and incarceration rate among the   community, we have a lot of work to do. So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities   working on child care  â€”   basically, targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most, and where it is needed the most are impoverished communities, often   and Latino"
198862,245,primary,381,"   On Tuesday,   Coates, who wrote a   Atlantic article titled  â€The Case for Reparationsâ€ in 2014, picked up on this answer. He asked why Sanders opposes reparations even as he, unlike Clinton, backs all other sorts of politically extreme policies:  The spectacle of a socialist candidate opposing reparations as â€divisiveâ€ (there are few political labels more divisive in the minds of Americans than socialist) is only rivaled by the implausibility of Sanders posing as a pragmatist. Sanders says the chance of getting reparations through Congress is â€nil,â€ a correct observation which could just as well apply to much of the Vermont senatorâ€™s own platform. The chances of a President Sanders coaxing a Republican Congress to pass a $1 trillion jobs and infrastructure bill are also nil. Considering Sandersâ€™s proposal for   health care, Paul Krugman asks, â€Is there any realistic prospect that a drastic overhaul could be enacted any time soon â€”  say, in the next eight years? No.â€  Other political commentators backed this critique. Hereâ€™s Jelani Cobb, who writes for the New Yorker:      Candidate emerges, says letâ€™s radically reimagine American democracy. Black person raises hand & then itâ€™s â€Hold on. .. Letâ€™s be realistic.â€  â€”   jelani cobb (@jelani9) January 20, 2016    That article prompted a response from rapper Killer Mike, a Sanders supporter, who emphasized his support for reparations but said they will never happen. Here are some of Killer Mikeâ€™s tweets, which argued that Sandersâ€™s platform would most benefit black communities even if they donâ€™t explicitly set out to achieve that goal:   The fact that blacks have to even justify the case for reparations is shameful"
198862,246,primary,2,"The fact that only 1 candidate is being called to task is  â€”   Killer Mike (@KillerMike) January 20, 2016      Bullshit. Especially when that candidate is the only one with policy proposal that directly effects the black community if elected.  â€”   Killer Mike (@KillerMike) January 20, 2016      Unless u are talking Rose Clemente & Cynthia  McKinney donâ€™t know if any American Politician will every day Reparations but I will hold out  â€”   Killer Mike (@KillerMike) January 20, 2016      Hope"
198862,247,tertiary,297,"Until that happens I will and encourage other blacks that are concerned with our poor, working class & middle class to vote Sanders.  â€”   Killer Mike (@KillerMike) January 20, 2016      His policy Could directly effect our community in a direct way.  â€”   Killer Mike (@KillerMike) January 20, 2016    But perhaps the strangest reaction came from the Hillary Clinton campaign. Even though Clinton does not support reparations, campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon decided to raise the issue on CNN as an example of Sandersâ€™s inconsistency:  Weâ€™ll see over the coming weeks if he can explain some of these plans that heâ€™s laid out on health care. He hasnâ€™t said how he would achieve a   system when we couldnâ€™t even get a public option with an entirely Democratic Congress. And yet when it comes to something like reparations, he dismisses it as completely unfeasible"
198862,248,tertiary,309,"These criticisms mischaracterize Sandersâ€™s position. For one, he has said how he would get a   system  â€”   by leading a political revolution of the   American public against special interests, which would help swing Congress toward backing such a plan. That may seem like a naive idea, but Sanders genuinely believes he can achieve this. And his answer on reparations actually explains how he hopes to do it. Reparations clash with Sandersâ€™s vision of a political revolution on economic issues            The most important part of Sandersâ€™s response wasnâ€™t that reparations are unrealistic, but that they are â€divisive.â€ This is crucial to understanding Sandersâ€™s campaign, which hopes to inspire a political revolution that unites the country against the wealthy class and establishment that have let inequality run amok. To make this plausible, though, Sanders believes the Democrats have to win over many more white voters to their cause. As he told Voxâ€™s Andrew Prokop in 2014, â€I do not know how you can concede the white working class to the Republican Party, which is working overtime to destroy the working class in America.â€    To Sanders, getting this voting bloc is critical to building the majority he hopes will bring about his political revolution  â€”   sweeping through Congress and forcing the passage of his policy platform, including a $1 trillion jobs and infrastructure bill and a   health care system. But supporting reparations would endanger Sandersâ€™s chances of getting support from the white working class. A 2014 YouGov survey found only 6 percent of white Americans support cash payments for black Americans who are the descendants of slaves, and 19 percent support education and job training programs:            If you look at this survey from the perspective that you need white   votes to lead a broader wave of change in America, reparations seem not just unfeasible but dangerous to your overall mission. Beyond the polling, reparations could be particularly divisive because they effectively use taxpayer money to compensate black Americans. Whether that compensation is deserved or not, that could be seen by a lot of people as the government favoring a certain group of people"
198862,249,secondary,388," a huge jobs program, and other policies in Sandersâ€™s platform, on the other hand, stand to benefit every American  â€”   which, in Sandersâ€™s view, makes them much more sellable to the general public. Critics see a broader problem with Sanders and race              The broader issue here, however, is not reparations but Sandersâ€™s consistent problem addressing racial tensions in America in a way that satisfies liberal advocates  â€”   the same advocates who are supposed to be see Sanders, a   radical and democratic socialist, as their candidate"
198862,250,primary,137,"  Coates dug into this in a   post on Sanders and reparations, arguing that Sanders is supposed to be the radical, liberal candidate in the race but doesnâ€™t act like it when it comes to race issues:  When a candidate points to high unemployment among black youth, as well as high incarceration rates, and then dubs himself a radical, it seems prudent to ask what radical   policies that candidate actually embraces. Hillary Clinton has no interest in being labeled radical,   or even liberal. Thus announcing that Clinton doesnâ€™t support reparations is akin to announcing that Ted Cruz doesnâ€™t support a womanâ€™s right to choose. The position is certainly wrong. But it is hardly a surprise, and doesnâ€™t run counter to the candidateâ€™s chosen name"
198862,251,primary,242,"In his previous post on the issue, Coates also argued that Sanders had the fundamentally wrong approach to race issues in general:  This is the â€class firstâ€ approach, originating in the myth that racism and socialism are necessarily incompatible. But raising the minimum wage doesnâ€™t really address the fact that black men without criminal records have about the same shot at   work as white men with them; nor can making college free address the wage gap between black and white graduates. Housing discrimination, historical and present, may well be the fulcrum of white supremacy. Affirmative action is one of the most disputed issues of the day. Neither are addressed in the â€racial justiceâ€ section of Sanders platform"
198862,252,secondary,353,"The criticism of Sandersâ€™s tepid â€class firstâ€ approach is something that has been leveled at his campaign time and time again. It was one of Black Lives Matter activistsâ€™ criticisms last year when they protested Sandersâ€™s rallies. From Sandersâ€™s perspective, economic inequality is the central issue facing the country  â€”   a truly existential problem. Itâ€™s not that Sanders doesnâ€™t see racial or other forms of inequality as serious problems in the US (he has, after all, a racial justice platform) but he has built his campaign on emphasizing how to fix this economic inequality above all else"
198862,253,secondary,50,"  He even sees, as he explained to Fusion, the fixes for economic inequality  â€”   such as a massive jobs program and   health care  â€”   as a way to also address racial inequality, since black communities are so often poor communities, too. Many Black Lives Matter activists and other racial justice advocates simply donâ€™t share this view. They feel, justifiably, that black people have been oppressed by centuries of US policies  â€”   from slavery to segregation to housing laws. And they feel those centuries of oppression warrant policies that specifically help black communities that have been held down for so long. The slogan â€Black Lives Matterâ€ speaks to this: It is not that other lives donâ€™t matter, but that America needs to prove that black lives also matter. Reparations could go a long ways to proving that. But these activists donâ€™t really have a candidate in the race that truly represents their values. Instead, the very liberal wing of the party that may have backed such a view has been enamored of a candidate who is emphasizing economic over racial inequality. Ultimately, Sandersâ€™s opposition to reparations demonstrates this rift between liberal activists  â€”   and thatâ€™s why his opposition has disappointed commentators like Coates"

170937,255,primary,232,"A national convention aims to offer a space for a political party to unify  â€”   to hone its message, set aside internal divisions and move forward toward a shared adversary. As Republicans sweep up confetti and try to forget the Ted   Trump flame war, Democrats pack their bags for Philadelphia, hoping to unite their own badly split party. Itâ€™s easy to say the divisions that surface in a major election year are somehow worse than the one before, anger and divisiveness compounding but with little change. The political rhetoric stays the same, year after year: â€. .. We are going to fix the system.â€ During her week in Cleveland, photographer Gabriella Demczuk explored the ways that people are embracing and challenging the Republican Partyâ€™s mission in this election  â€”   both from inside and outside the party. Here is a selection of what she saw."
174465,256,secondary,337,"What do Democrats in West Virginia and Republicans in California have in common? Many likely knew that their presidential election votes wouldnâ€™t â€count.â€ Of course, these votes were counted, but anyone with a minimal knowledge of U. S. politics could have guessed that California would vote Democratic in the presidential election (Clinton won it by 29 points) and that West Virginia would go Republican (Trump won by nearly 42 points). And because of the United Statesâ€™ peculiar electoral college system, in which the winner takes all the electoral votes in all but two states, all the California Trump votes and West Virginia Clinton votes didnâ€™t really matter much. So voters in those states might have reasonably shrugged and stayed home on Election Day. The data suggest this may be happening. Of 15 states that NPR labeled as battlegrounds or leaning states in its final battleground map, 12 had turnout rates above the national rate  â€”   58. 4 percent of the   population. Itâ€™s a bit of a â€duhâ€ trend, but no less striking. And while in a comparison like this we always must acknowledge that  â€”   say it with us  â€”   correlation does not imply causation, living in a battleground state encourages turnout, says Michael McDonald, associate professor of political science at the University of Florida, and who runs the U. S. Elections Project website. â€Whatâ€™s happening there in a state like in these battleground states itâ€™s the perception that the election is going to be close thatâ€™s going to drive them to have a higher turnout,â€ he said. Not only that, but campaigns generally run robust     operations in battleground states. So when   in Florida are encouraging people to get to the polls, it would make sense that the state would have a much higher turnout than Wyoming, where it doesnâ€™t really make much sense for either party to be too aggressive (Trump won it by more than 46 points). Convenience matters, A lot of those   states have more in common than being battlegrounds many have also made voting more convenient. One factor may be ease of registration. While this yearâ€™s turnout rate among   adults was 58. 4 percent, the rate tends to be much higher among registered adults. In 2012, 84. 3 percent of registered voters in fact voted, according to data compiled by the Pew Research Center. Part of the difficulty may be with the registration and voting process. As it happens, the six states with the highest turnout also happened to have   voter registration. Early voting is another way states make voting easier. However, itâ€™s much harder to find a trend in the early voting data, in part because so many states have it (or    absentee voting). That said, itâ€™s notable that the three    states, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington  â€”   two of which are not battlegrounds  â€”   are among the   states in the nation. That makes sense, McDonald says, because some research shows that people tend to turn out when they have had contact about voting, whether itâ€™s via mail or phone or in person. And   voting is about the most direct contact a person can get. â€Thereâ€™s no greater reminder that thereâ€™s an election coming than getting a ballot in your mailbox,â€ McDonald said. And finally (and perhaps most controversially) there are voter ID laws. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists nine states with some form of â€strictâ€ law requiring that people show identification at the polls. Proponents of voter ID laws  â€”   often Republicans  â€”   argue that these laws prevent voter fraud. However, opponents (who tend to be Democrats) argue that   fraud is very rare to begin with, and that these laws depress turnout, particularly among minorities. Some studies have supported this view, but what exactly it means is complicated. As the New York Timesâ€™ Nate Cohn wrote in a deep dive into the research, â€the   margin of disenfranchisement  â€”   the number of registered voters who do not appear to have photo identification  â€”   grossly overstates the potential electoral consequences of these laws.â€ Lots of other factors, None of our above analyses are exactly a scientific study  â€”   just a look at the raw data and what trends stand out. Just because a trend seems to show up here doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s causal (and just because it doesnâ€™t stand out doesnâ€™t mean thereâ€™s not a relationship there). Nor is this by any means a full accounting of factors related to turnout. There are many other correlations out there:   whites and African Americans both tend to have higher turnout than Latinos and   for example. Likewise, older voters turn out more reliably than younger voters. In addition,   Americans tend to turn out in higher numbers than   Americans. So if your state has massive turnout (or massive numbers of people who stay home) exactly why thatâ€™s happening is likely a complicated story."

On Wednesday, LÃ³pez Rivera was released from house arrest in Puerto Rico. The    had been in custody for seditious conspiracy since 1981. The clemency decision was controversial. â€To his supporters, he is a freedom fighter for the cause of Puerto Rican independence. To others, heâ€™s a terrorist,â€ NPRâ€™s Kelly McEvers noted at the time. LÃ³pez Rivera was part of a militant group that fought for Puerto Rican independence, called the FALN. â€Between 1974 and 1983, the FALN claimed responsibility for more than 70 bombings in New York, Chicago and Washington, D.

Hinojosa explains: â€The FBI had no physical evidence to prove that LÃ³pez Rivera set any bombs himself. So instead, he was tried for a seditious conspiracy to overthrow the power of the United States in connection with 28 FALN bombings in Chicago. â€So his supporters essentially say that seditious conspiracy is, quote, â€™a political crime for simply opposing the United States government.â€™ And they say that his   sentence was essentially unfair. But his opponents say that he is essentially an unrepentant terrorist.â€ On Wednesday, LÃ³pez Rivera emerged from his daughterâ€™s home in San Juan, Puerto Rico, according to The Associated Press. He had been transferred there from a prison in Terre Haute, Ind. weeks after Obama commuted his sentence. â€Roughly 50 people congregated in the streets outside the apartment building in San Juanâ€™s Santurce district holding flowers and Puerto Rican flags, some chanting: â€™Free at last! ,â€™â€ the news service added. â€A group of singers from University of Puerto Ricoâ€™s choir harmonized as Oscar drove past.â€ The AP says LÃ³pez Rivera is expected to be honored in Chicago later this week, and as well as â€at the June 11 Puerto Rican Day parade along New Yorkâ€™s Fifth Avenue.â€ As NPR has reported, a number of   figures had called for Obama to grant him clemency, including Sen.

Trump now holds the record for the lowest initial job approval rating as well as the highest initial disapproval rating in Gallup surveys dating back to Dwight D. Eisenhower. â€ That reality  â€”   the rotten poll numbers, the low turnout at his inauguration, the massive turnout at worldwide protests, his widely panned appearance at the CIA and his press secretary Sean Spicerâ€™s disastrous debut with the White House press corps on Saturday  â€”   seems to have thrown the narcissistic   into an emotional tailspin. The Post reports that as events unfolded on Friday and Saturday â€œTrump grew increasingly and visibly enraged. â€ We know two things from this: 1.) Heâ€™s an emotional train wreck before much of anything has happened and 2.) Those close to him already started spilling the beans, perhaps to exonerate themselves and perhaps to communicate to their boss through the media. Trumpâ€™s ire simply confirms what we already knew, namely that his insatiable need for approval and his rage when he does not receive it make for an alarmingly unpresidential demeanor"

To repeat, nothing much of substance, certainly no major policy defeat, has yet occurred. One shudders to think what will happen when setbacks do occur. Trumpâ€™s inability to acknowledge his own lack of support prompts him to seek refuge in â€œalternative factsâ€  â€”   to lie to himself and others. The Post reports, â€œDays after being sworn in, President Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes   â€¦     Two people familiar with the meeting said Trump spent about 10 minutes at the start of the bipartisan gathering rehashing the campaign. He also told them that between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular vote. â€ The obsession with replaying the election and concocting a phony excuse for losing the popular vote reminds us that despite mockery for constant lying, Trump cannot help himself. He lies because reality wonâ€™t conform to his narcissistic view of the world. Imagine how lawmakers perceive him after a performance like that. Do they imagine he is unstable? Dishonest? Well, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer ( . Y.) wants them to think long and hard about Trumpâ€™s demeanor. He turned up the heat on Republicans to disavow Trumpâ€™s fabulism. Reviewing the weekend events, Schumer said on the Senate floor. â€œWhatever your politics, in order to debate, argue, compromise, and get things done for the American people, we have to be able to agree on a baseline of facts. Facts arenâ€™t partisan. They donâ€™t have â€˜alternatives.â€™ The alternative to fact is fiction. â€ He added, â€œIf this presidency is going to be based on ignoring the facts on the ground  â€”   weâ€™re going to have huge problems. â€ He went on to explain why Trumpâ€™s credibility (or lack thereof) will pose a big problem down the road. (â€œIf the White House is ignoring facts on the ground and is willing to make up â€˜alternative factsâ€™ about crowd size, what else are they willing to stretch the truth about? National security? What Vladimir Putin is really up to? The implications are terrifying. â€) Schumer rightly scolded Republicans, who need to decide whether to enable Trumpâ€™s behavior or stand up to him. â€œThe folks who can really help rein in the president in are the members of his own party, who have a special responsibility to do so,â€ he said. â€œBut they have been totally silent when President Trump has been saying and doing things that they know are wrong. They should be speaking out for the good of the country. â€ Ironically, Trump accuses the media of trying to delegitimize his presidency, but as Schumer pointed out, Trump does that on his own  â€”   and may wind up dragging other Republicans into his morass of lies."

196162,268,primary,7," On Wednesday morning, two Democratic senators did something that had been declared out of bounds by their Republican colleagues just the night before  â€”   they read a letter from Coretta Scott King on the Senate floor"
196162,269,secondary,89,"  Written in 1986, the letter criticizes the civil rights record of Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) President Trumpâ€™s nominee for attorney general. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) read from it late Tuesday night, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) found her in violation of Senate Rule 19  â€”   an obscure and rarely enforced restriction barring senators from using â€œany form of words [to] imputeâ€ the motives of another senator during floor debate. The Republican Senate then voted to prevent Warren from speaking for the rest of the debate over Sessionsâ€™s confirmation. But around 10 the next morning, Sens. Tom Udall ( ) and Sherrod Brown ( ) went to the floor and read Kingâ€™s letter, including portions of it that directly attacked Sessions. This time, McConnell decided against using Rule 19 to cut off Udall or Brown  â€”   even though both of the Democratic senators were certainly also â€œimputingâ€ Sessionsâ€™s record. What changed since Warrenâ€™s speech was about 12 hours of relentlessly negative press and social media coverage about the decision to censure her. â€œIt backfired badly,â€ said Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution. â€McConnell has every incentive to get these nominees into office as quickly and quietly as possible. By trying to do it more quietly, he in fact ginned up much more attention.â€    Mitch McConnell flies the white flag after censure backfires            When Warren spoke on the floor of the Senate Tuesday night, only a few hundred people were tuned in to  . There was almost nobody in the Senate chamber watching what was a   as each member of the Senate Democratic caucus delivered his or her stump speech opposing Sessions. Warren herself appeared caught off guard as McConnell and Sen. Steve Daines ( ) told her she would not be allowed to speak for the rest of the debate over Sessionsâ€™s nomination"
196162,270,tertiary,76,"  The ensuing backlash against McConnellâ€™s decision turned a routine and otherwise unremarkable floor speech into a national media controversy. After she was cut off, Warren recorded a Facebook Live video on the steps of the Capitol decrying McConnellâ€™s decision; it got more than 3 million views. Democratic senators beat the drum of outrage, rallying to Warrenâ€™s defense:      This is unreal.

But McConnell decided to let the speeches proceed uninterrupted, suggesting that he realized the censure was helping Democrats organize and mobilize their base  â€”   at least more than letting Warren speak would have, Democrats on the Hill say"
196162,274,tertiary,148,"  â€œItâ€™s clear this backfired, and now theyâ€™re trying to kill the story,â€ said one Senate Democratic aide. Democrats have little to gain, and everything to lose, from supporting Trump            McConnellâ€™s backpedaling wonâ€™t change much about Sessionsâ€™s confirmation  â€”   he has enough votes to get through on a   vote this week. But the decision does underscore the steadfast opposition Senate Democrats have shown against Trump, propelled in large part by persistent progressive outrage at the Trump administrationâ€™s actions. â€œThereâ€™s a bit of   going on for the Democrats: Be responsive to a base thatâ€™s very mad, pull out the stops by showing youâ€™re fighting, and get people mad and revved up for future legislative battles,â€ says Binder. This dynamic has changed dramatically since the confirmation hearings began. In   Sen. Cory Booker ( ) became the first senator in US history to testify against the Cabinet confirmation of another senator when he did so against Sessions at a judiciary committee hearing. The historic breach of Senate norms was met with shock on Capitol Hill: The Washington Post ran an      interview in which Booker explained how he agonized over the choice before deciding it was the right thing to do. His speech against Sessions was carried live on the major primetime television networks. Dozens of protesters filled the halls outside Bookerâ€™s speech in the Dirksen Senate Office Building. But less than two weeks later, Booker was under fire again  â€”   not from the right for refusing to cooperate with Trump, but from the left for voting for some of Trumpâ€™s nominees. Similar criticism erupted against Sens. Brown and Warren when they decided to vote to confirm Ben Carson to run the Housing and Urban Development Department"
196162,275,secondary,203,"  Bookerâ€™s attack on Sessions was an early sign of what was to come  â€”   now every single Democratic senator except Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) plans to vote against him, according to the Washington Post. Far more Senate Democrats plan to vote against the remaining Trump nominees than voted for the initial nominees who were cleared. In part, thatâ€™s because Trumpâ€™s more controversial nominees have taken longer to move through the confirmation process than the ones Democrats had fewer objections to. But it also reflects how mass grassroots resistance in the first three weeks of Trumpâ€™s administration has given Senate Democrats every incentive to do what they can to attack the presidentâ€™s nominees, regardless of Senate norms and customs. â€œThey know these [Trump] nominees are all going to get confirmed, so these are opportunities for them to send a message to their base that theyâ€™re hearing their demand to stand up,â€ Binder says. â€œAnd thereâ€™s very little cost except some negative tweets from the president, who their voters donâ€™t like anyway. â€ "
164680,276,secondary,33,"Updated at 5:51 p. m. ET, President Trump is responding to the backlash against the allegations that he shared â€highly classifiedâ€ information with the Russians by saying he had â€the absolute right to doâ€ so. He tweeted Tuesday morning: And he went a step further, again taking aim at fired former FBI Director James Comey and â€leakersâ€: The irony seemed to be lost on Trump that he himself is being accused of being a â€leakerâ€  â€”   and that he criticized Hillary Clintonâ€™s â€extremely carelessâ€ handling of classified information during the campaign, calling her â€not fitâ€: The Washington Post broke the news Monday night, and others confirmed and added to the reporting, that Trump revealed to Russian officials in a meeting in the Oval Office details of an ISIS plot to use laptops on airplanes. The information was classified and reportedly came from an ally in the Middle East. The New York Times, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal reported later Tuesday that the classified intelligence in question was provided by Israel  â€”   an important U. S. ally and one of the countries Trump will travel to later this week on his first foreign trip as president. Passing along the intelligence from Israel, The Times noted, raises the possibility that the Russians could give it to Iran, their close ally but Israelâ€™s main antagonist. NPR has not confirmed the details of the reports. White House press secretary Sean Spicer wouldnâ€™t comment Tuesday on whether or not Israel was the source of the intelligence. Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the U. S. said in a statement, reported by The New York Times, that â€Israel has full confidence in our   relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump.â€ Trump national security adviser H. R. McMaster said Monday night that the story in The Post, â€as reported, is false.â€ But he also noted that the president talked about â€common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation. At no time, at no time, were intelligence sources or methods discussed, and the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known.â€ McMaster took to the lectern in the White House Briefing Room on Tuesday and told reporters that he stood by his statement. â€The premise of that article is false,â€ McMaster said, though he did not say the entirety of the article is false and would not confirm nor deny that Trump revealed classified information to the Russians. â€What the president shared was wholly appropriate,â€ McMaster said. He added that there was â€no lapse in national security.â€ Instead, he focused on leaks. â€I think national security is put at risk by this leak and leaks like this,â€ he said. McMaster also did not say whether the president decided in the moment to share the information, but the adviser revealed a key detail that is going to raise more questions. â€The president wasnâ€™t even aware where this information came from,â€ McMaster said. â€He wasnâ€™t briefed.â€ Reporters were not able to follow up because McMaster then walked off. But where the information came from is a key piece of information, given that it could put operatives from a key ally at risk. None of that explains why the White House was reaching out to the CIA and National Security Agency to let them know what the president had revealed. McMaster said that was done merely out of an â€overabundance of caution.â€ Michael Anton, spokesman for the National Security Council, tells NPRâ€™s Tamara Keith, â€My conscience is clear saying there is no contradiction between McMasterâ€™s statement and the presidentâ€™s tweet.â€ Becca Glover Watkins, a spokeswoman for Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr,  . C. tells NPRâ€™s Geoff Bennett that the committee â€has reached out to the White House to request additional information on recent reports about alleged dissemination of intelligence information.â€ By almost 5 p. m. Burr told reporters he still hadnâ€™t heard back from the White House. Itâ€™s been â€a very busy day,â€ Burr said, â€but we hope to talk with them before we leave.â€ â€Iâ€™d prefer to have a conversation with an individual who was in the room about what actually was said, and then we can legitimately comment on whether we have concerns about what was said,â€ Burr also told reporters Tuesday evening. And an aide to a member of the House Intelligence Committee confirmed to NPRâ€™s Susan Davis that CIA Director Mike Pompeo will brief the committee Tuesday evening. Pompeoâ€™s appearance was previously scheduled, but obviously all subjects are on the table, the aide said. To be totally clear: If Trump revealed classified information, it is not illegal. The president can declassify anything he wants  â€”   just by saying it. Thereâ€™s no formal process he needs to go through. But this kind of information was so â€highly classifiedâ€ that disclosing it could subject any other person to jail time. Lawfare blog weighed in on that on Monday: â€The reason is that the very purpose of the classification system is to protect information the President, usually through his subordinates, thinks sensitive. So the President determines the system of designating classified information through Executive Order, and he is entitled to depart from it at will. Currently, Executive Order 13526 governs national security information. â€The Supreme Court has stated in Department of the Navy v. Egan that â€™[the Presidentâ€™s] authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security . .. flows primarily from this Constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.â€™ Because of his broad constitutional authority in this realm, the president can, at any time, either declassify information or decide whom to share it with.â€ Lawfare got into more of the potential problems, like the possibility of this disclosure violating the presidentâ€™s oath of office and of it raising the stakes over whether Trump records conversations in the Oval Office and for his FBI director pick. Still, the issue of criminality is not the whole of the discussion. NPRâ€™s Mara Liasson said on NPR podcast Up First that what Trump is accused of doing is â€lawful but awful.â€ But there are also potential national security consequences. There is the potential that: 1) The Middle East ally that gave this information to the U. S. will be less likely to share in the future, 2) Other   U. S. allies may be less likely to share intelligence, and, 3) If the first two happen, Americans would be put at risk, as the U. S. tries to prevent terrorist attacks and threats like the one Trump allegedly told the Russians about. Trump also continues to have problems with the intelligence community. Itâ€™s never a good thing for a president to be at odds with some of the very people who are tasked with keeping the country safe. If the focus of either or both is getting back at the other, whoâ€™s watching the gate? Of course, the U. S. has had problematic intelligence situations with the rest of the world in the past. Some in China are upset that the NSA, for example, was reportedly behind the origination of the virus that was used in the recent ransomware attack before losing control of it. The NSA was also at the heart of the Edward Snowden drama, which revealed that the U. S. spied on world leaders, including close allies. And, of course, there was the intelligence failures over the lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the rationale that led to the 2003 invasion of the country. U. S. alliances survived those and more, but they all occurred under presidents who were far more careful with their language, not to mention their tweets."
173920,277,tertiary,19,"Troll dolls, those novelty toys with fluorescent Don King hair, are now the stars of their own movie. Itâ€™s a balance between   fun and the kind of offbeat humor that aims to keep adults in their seats. Tending to these relentlessly charming creatures is veteran animator Mike Mitchell. Heâ€™s worked with many different, er, species (a sponge, chipmunks, ogres) in his career. Mitchell claims Shrek is the most difficult of all of them. Trolls, he says, are by far the easiest. Thatâ€™s because Mitchell made all of these stubby little creatures  â€”   save one named Branch  â€”   extremely happy. Think pink, yellow and purple happy. The trolls sing and dance and have regular â€hug times.â€ Mitchell says he never collected trolls, so he did some homework. The first Troll doll was made in 1959 by a poor, Danish woodcarver named Thomas Dam. Damâ€™s daughter was afraid of the greedy,   trolls who live under bridges in story books. â€So he decided to create a new kind of troll, one with outstretched arms, a smile, ready for a hug,â€ says Mitchell. In the Trollsâ€™ village in the film, the leader of â€hug timeâ€ is the fluorescent pink heroine, Princess Poppy. Sheâ€™s every trollsâ€™ cheerleader. Think Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm meets My Little Pony. Her favorite hobby: Scrapbooking. Since Mitchell wanted everything in the movie to look and feel handmade, the job of creating those scrapbooks fell to a very skeptical Priscilla Wong: â€Iâ€™m like, â€™Scrapbooking? Isnâ€™t that kind of what grandmothers do?â€™ â€ But Wong, a visual development artist for DreamWorks, knew she shared the same irreverent humor as the others working on Trolls. â€Itâ€™s like magical creatures barfing rainbows and pooping cupcakes. That kind of sums up my aesthetic,â€ she laughs. For the first attempt at a scrapbook, Wong says she used aluminum foil, old candy, crinkled paper and scraps of faux fur. â€The directors joked that it looked like I took roadkill and scrapbooked it,â€ she admits. So she went back to the drawing board and ended up using your basic,   materials: Colored felt and paper. When Princess Poppy isnâ€™t scrapbooking or pepping up her friends or initiating hug time, she and her fellow trolls are singing and dancing. News flash: That Justin Timberlake song â€Canâ€™t Stop The Feelingâ€ was originally written for Trolls. â€I mean, he said he was going to make it a hit, and I laughed at him. But, lo and behold, I guess thatâ€™s what Justin Timberlake does,â€ says Mitchell. Timberlake, who also served as the movieâ€™s executive music producer, voices the pessimistic troll Branch in the film. With that â€sunshineâ€ in their â€pockets,â€ as the song goes, the trolls are prey for the Bergens, gigantic monsters with bad teeth, designed in colors like grey and avocado green. The miserable creatures hunt and eat trolls because they want their happiness. The Bergensâ€™ anthem is the sardonic Gorillaz single â€Clint Eastwood,â€ first released in 2001  â€”   a bit of edgy nostalgia for restless parents. Ultimately, Trolls is not a battle between good and evil, but rather between gloom and glitter. Mike Mitchell thinks we need a story right now about finding happiness. â€I find all of the news  â€”   and most media and the Internet  â€”   is so dark and itâ€™s so depressing. Itâ€™s so scary, not just for kids but for me,â€ he says. â€So I just wanted to make a film that really just makes people think about happiness. Letâ€™s not undervalue a positive attitude, and letâ€™s explore happiness and maybe discover that weâ€™re in charge  â€”   and that happiness is deep down inside every one of us.â€ If that means making a movie with scrapbooking trolls and cute creatures that poop cupcakes, so be it."

208982,279,secondary,634,")  The FBI says investigators are seeking public help in figuring out what the two attackers who opened fire in San Bernardino, Calif. last month did during an   window after the shooting. Authorities have figured out some of what the    killers did during the   window between the shooting on Dec. 2 and a bloody gun battle between the attackers and police officers, David Bow dich, assistant director in charge of the FBIâ€™s Los Angeles office, said at a news conference Tuesday. However, he said there is a period of time about two hours after the shooting that remains a mystery. Bowdich described the   gap as critical because authorities do not know if the two attackers  â€”   Siyed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who killed 14 people at a company holiday gathering  â€”   went to a home, business or made any contact with anyone else, he said. â€œUntil we close that gap we just donâ€™t know for sure,â€ he said"
208982,280,secondary,151,"    The   period between the attack and the gun battle had been a mystery in the weeks since the fatal attack. Authorities had not released many details about what Farook and Malik did before police officers found their vehicle, chased them and, ultimately, killed them in a shootout involving hundreds of gunshots fired on a residential street. On the morning of Dec. 2, Farook traveled to the Inland Regional Center for a company event. He was there for nearly two hours before he left for 19 minutes, then returned with his wife, which is when the shooting took place, Bowdich said. [San Bernardino shooter spent years steeped in extremism before attack] What happened next is still not fully clear. Bowdich said that traffic cameras, surveillance footage, witness accounts and other resources helped investigators figure out some of the places Farook and Malik drove and spent time, though they do not necessarily know everything the couple did when they stopped. About 45 minutes after the shooting, the pair went to Lake Seccombe in the city, Bowdich said, so evidence recovery divers were sent into the water to see what they could find. On Tuesday, Bowdich said that items were recovered from that lake, but none appeared relevant to the investigation. An hour after that stop, though, is a window that remains mysterious to officials. Between 12:59 p. m. and 1:17 p. m. â€œweâ€™re dark,â€ Bowdich said Tuesday. Bowdich also reiterated that authorities do not believe the shooters were directed by any outside organization. â€œAs of today, we do not see any indications of a   terrorist act,â€ he said. â€œThis seems to be an inspired terrorist act. â€ [Some people wonâ€™t stop believing there was a third shooter at the San Bernardino attack] Farook and Malik had discussed â€œtheir joint commitment to jihad and to martyrdomâ€ in private messages exchanged online, discussions that occurred as long as two years before the attack, FBI Director James B. Comey said last month. Shortly after the shooting, Malik posted a note on Facebook pledging her allegiance to Abu Bakr   the emir of the   Islamic State. Authorities say this posting was also made on behalf of her husband. The Islamic State later said that two â€œsupportersâ€ had carried out the attack, praising the shooting without directly claiming responsibility for it. Last month, police arrested a former neighbor of Malikâ€™s who bought the assault rifles that were later used in the San Bernardino shooting. Enrique Marquez Jr. was charged with conspiring to carry out other terrorist attacks with Malik in 2012. Federal officials alleged that Marquez and Malik had planned to attack other targets, including a community college and a highway"

But for those in the know, Pennsylvaniaâ€™s second city is well on its way to establishing itself as the Silicon Valley of the east  â€”   and even its roads are helping. Unlike many American cities, Pittsburgh road system is literally off the grid, its origins dating back to twisty,   forest trails. Then there are the cityâ€™s 446 bridges to navigate. More importantly Pittsburgh boasts the robotics department at   University, recognized as the leading academic institution in the field"
156308,283,tertiary,472,"It was here last month that Pittsburgh opened its doors to show the world why it is so well positioned to be a new tech hub. The city is now in a position to capitalize on the infrastructure of the past in ways that could not have been anticipated at the depths of its   depression two decades ago, when the cityâ€™s population was half its industry peak and the unemployment rate was worse than in Detroit. Last week, the city hosted Thrival, a   showcase of panel discussions and exhibitions designed to show off the cityâ€™s   charms. From robotics to biotech, performing arts to healthcare, the cityâ€™s premier boosters  â€”   many locals or returning natives  â€”   sought to describe the cityâ€™s upswing"
156308,284,tertiary,444,"The twin keys to the cityâ€™s current success, says the festivalâ€™s executive producer, Dan Law, are education and medicine  â€”   eds and meds  â€”   that helped bridge the gap between old industrial Pittsburgh and a new Pittsburgh thatâ€™s about innovation and technology. Now, instead of leaving, students from Pittsburghâ€™s tech university departments have more options to stay. â€œEds and meds are the bedrock of the economic transition,â€ says Law. â€œUPMC  â€”   University of Pittsburgh Medical Center  â€”   alone is a $13bn health system and there are dozens of ancillary industries that began to innovate. So young people started to get jobs here and economic growing around the core economic pillars. â€ Correspondingly, the cityâ€™s arts and culture are thriving. â€œThe City of Bridges is in the throes of a          culinary renaissance,â€ according to Bon Appetit magazine. It rated one Spanish restaurant, Morcilla, the fourth best restaurant in the US. Thereâ€™s a trendy Ace Hotel that was originally a YMCA and, of course, the Warhol Museum, dedicated to its most famous artist, and the Carnegie Museums of Art. â€œAt the centre of it all, Pittsburgh is becoming a diversified innovation economy,â€ say Luke Skurman, founder of Niche. com and one of the founders of Thrill Mill, a    organization providing mentorship and collaborative workspace to   startups. â€œWhen I graduated Carnegie Mellon and stayed, people thought I was bananas. Now itâ€™s becoming fashionable to do so. â€ Among the attendees at Thrival were Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian American neuropathologist who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players, and Jennifer Krusius, general manager at Uber. The transportation firm has about 500 employees in the cityâ€™s tech Strip district and plans to start testing as many as 100 Volvo sport utility vehicles on the cityâ€™s streets. Many of Uberâ€™s employees were hired directly from  â€™s computer labs and the stateâ€™s approach to the technology  â€”   called greenlight governing  â€”   effectively encouraged investment in the field. Uber estimates its investment will reach $1bn over the next few years. â€œItâ€™s not just about   cars,â€ says Law. â€œItâ€™s about the future of urban mobility. How do you create smarter and more efficient cities. â€ Pittsburgh is ideal, he says, â€œbecause if you are going to design a car that needs to navigate some of the most complex road networks and systems, youâ€™re not going to get a bigger challenge than here. Itâ€™s old, it was planned poorly, itâ€™s built around hills and valleys, and the roads are windy and steep. If it works in Pittsburgh, it can work anywhere. â€  The firm is not alone: General Motors, Google  â€”   which has centered its engineering facilities here and employs 600  â€”   and Intel have also come to Pittsburgh. While Apple, which employs 500 here, has not stated the reason for its interest, it is known to have already developed a prototype vehicle. But the cityâ€™s   regulatory approach and an intelligent workforce is not the only reason Pittsburgh is becoming ground zero for   widely regarded as one of the largest untapped economies"

The entrepreneurial knack is not just to create incremental innovation but to change the entire dynamic of healthcare innovation. â€  Tech companies, including Google, eye healthcareâ€™s copious resources of data  â€”   UPMCâ€™s nine petabytes of data is doubling every 18 months  â€”   with some envy. And vice versa. Says Shrestha: â€œLetâ€™s create solutions that leverage machine learning and    technologies to create products we can then commercialize. â€  There may also be a natural symbiosis between healthcare advances and techâ€™s interest in transport. An ageing population suggests more will need assistance in terms of mobility. â€œThereâ€™s a ton of connections and overlap,â€ says Capsambelis. â€œA lot of people will still need cars, but there wonâ€™t be as many drivers. â€ The spirit of entrepreneurship suffuses the robotics lab at  .

201572,290,secondary,95," Donald Trumpâ€™s big economic speech wasnâ€™t particularly revealing as to the candidateâ€™s core economic philosophy, but it clarified the precarious place his campaign has come to rest. Trump has merged the weaknesses of an unqualified, outsider candidacy with the unpopular, plutocratic tilt of the conservative billionaire classâ€™s policy preferences. Itâ€™s a     campaign"
201572,291,primary,137,"  It didnâ€™t have to be this way. The Trump campaignâ€™s original pitch made sense. Trump was a confident, celebrated businessman. His wealth and celebrity protected him from the corruptions of our campaign finance system. His life outside Washington freed him from the stultified ideology of the Beltwayâ€™s stagnant elites. He would bring an outsiderâ€™s eye, an executiveâ€™s efficiency, and a populistâ€™s touch to crafting a policy agenda that worked for the working man  â€”   the kind of policy agenda Republicans should have been pushing all along but were too addicted to corporate cash to dare consider. And for a while, this looked to be the campaign Trump was running. He declared he would raise taxes on â€the very wealthy,â€ that his plan would cost him â€a fortune.â€ He said his health plan was â€going to take care of everybody,â€ and promised, even though it was â€an   thing to say,â€ that â€the governmentâ€™s gonna pay for it.â€ He swore he wouldnâ€™t cut Social Security and Medicare"
201572,292,primary,1,"  The problem was that Trump was lying. Trumpâ€™s tax plan is basically Paul Ryanâ€™s tax plan We have now seen two version of Trumpâ€™s tax plan. Both have been massive, regressive giveaways to the rich  â€”   including, as far as we can tell, to Trump himself (because he wonâ€™t release his tax returns, itâ€™s hard to say exactly how his plans would affect his finances)"
201572,293,tertiary,2,"  The new version of Trumpâ€™s plan  â€”   which, for reasons he hasnâ€™t really explained, appears to supersede the old version of his plan  â€”   offers vast benefits to the wealthiest and almost nothing for the truly poor. Trump massively cuts taxes on the rich, massively cuts taxes on corporations, and completely eliminates estate taxes for the very wealthiest families. Whatever this is, it sure as hell isnâ€™t populism"
201572,294,secondary,19,"          If you want to get into the weeds, Voxâ€™s Dylan Matthews runs through the gory details here, but if you just want the gist, the tell in Trumpâ€™s speech was this sentence: â€We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25, and 33 percent.â€    What Trump has done is crib the basic structure of the House GOPâ€™s tax plan, which is one of the single most unpopular policy documents that exists in American politics. I donâ€™t quite know what Democrats would do if they couldnâ€™t run against the GOPâ€™s   to add trillions to the deficit to cut taxes on the rich, and it looks like Iâ€™m not going to find out: Trump has put that plan at the center of his policy agenda. By the way, if you want to understand why Paul Ryan has held to his endorsement of Trump, despite the many humiliations and embarrassments Trump has visited on Ryan, this is the answer: Trump is willing to sign some version of Ryanâ€™s budget into law, and Hillary Clinton isnâ€™t. Trumpâ€™s plan to increase the number of uninsured Americans Itâ€™s not just taxes where Trump betrays his heterodox rhetoric to embrace unpopular, orthodox conservative policy"
201572,295,primary,134,"  Trumpâ€™s health care plan follows the same grooves. Far from fulfilling his promise that he was â€going to take care of everybodyâ€ at government expense, his plan repeals Obamacare. It allows insurers to sell plans across state lines  â€”   a bad idea that mainly redistributes money from the sick to the healthy. It   Medicaid, a way of cutting Medicaid under the guise of increasing state flexibility. It encourages the use of health savings accounts. It makes insurance premiums deductible  â€”   which does nothing for poorer taxpayers who donâ€™t have an income tax liability in the first place. Put it all together, and Trumpâ€™s plan does the opposite of what he promised: Rather than diverging from Republican orthodoxy in the direction of covering more people, it diverges in the direction of covering fewer people. As Sarah Kliff notes, Trumpâ€™s reliance on tax deductions makes his plan less progressive than most Republican reform plans, which rely on tax credits that are available to people even if they donâ€™t have any income tax liability. His plan would also allow insurers to discriminate based on preexisting conditions. If you repealed Obamacare and replaced it with this plan, youâ€™d see millions more people fall into the ranks of the uninsured. â€Thereâ€™s something of a mismatch between Trumpâ€™s talking points and the specific policies heâ€™s proposed so far,â€ Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. â€His public comments suggest that there would be a safety net to take care of people who get sick and canâ€™t afford health care on their own. His policy proposals, at least at this point, donâ€™t accomplish that.â€ Trump is a weak, unqualified messenger for unpopular, conventional policy ideas Trump does have his deviations from Republican orthodoxy  â€”   namely on trade and, to some degree, on immigration (though for all the sound and fury, Trumpâ€™s practical immigration policy puts him in the mainstream of House conservatives). But his points of agreement are more numerous  â€”   and, for the middle class, more consequential  â€”   than his points of disagreement. In addition to his tax and health care plans, a mere eight years after the last financial crisis, Trump is promising â€a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.â€ So if you thought part of the new populism was a fury at Wall Streetâ€™s ability to outrun regulators and crash the global economy, well, Trump disagrees"
201572,296,primary,126,"  Meanwhile, his polls show that heâ€™s a singularly poor messenger for any kind of policy plan, because heâ€™s managed to position himself as the kind of outsider who Americans think canâ€™t understand the political system, rather than the kind of outsider who can fix it"
201572,297,secondary,140,"          According to a new Washington   News poll, a majority of voters simply donâ€™t think Trump is qualified to serve as president. And itâ€™s not just qualifications  â€”   they donâ€™t think he has the personality or temperament to serve as president (67 to 31 percent) they donâ€™t think he has a solid understanding of world affairs (64 to 33 percent) and they donâ€™t think heâ€™s honest and trustworthy (62 to 34 percent). Trumpâ€™s campaign was supposed to be an answer to the question, â€Could Republicans find a candidate untainted by the political system and free from the the most unpopular points of conservative orthodoxy?â€ Instead, itâ€™s been an answer to the question, â€Could Republicans find a candidate who reminds voters what they like about professional, vetted politicians but who nevertheless shackles himself to the least popular parts of the conservative policy agenda?â€ Well, they succeeded. And so what theyâ€™ve gotten in Trump is a     candidate: He lacks the credentials, skills, relationships, and credibility of an accomplished politician, but heâ€™s running atop a surprisingly conventional, and deeply unpopular, policy agenda"

164570,299,tertiary,189,"As a neonatal intensive care nurse, Lauren Bloomstein had been taking care of other peopleâ€™s babies for years. Finally, at 33, she was expecting one of her own. The prospect of becoming a mother made her giddy, her husband, Larry, recalled recently â€”   â€the happiest and most alive Iâ€™d ever seen her.â€ When Lauren was 13, her own mother had died of a massive heart attack. Lauren had lived with her older brother for a while, then with a neighbor in Hazlet, N. J. who was like a surrogate mom, but in important ways sheâ€™d grown up mostly alone. The chance to create her own family, to be the mother she didnâ€™t have, touched a place deep inside her. â€All she wanted to do was be loved,â€ said Frankie Hedges, who took Lauren in as a teenager and thought of her as her daughter. â€I think everybody loved her, but nobody loved her the way she wanted to be loved.â€ Other than some nausea in her first trimester, the pregnancy went smoothly. Lauren was â€tired in the beginning, achy in the end,â€ said Jackie Ennis, her best friend since high school, who talked to her at least once a day. â€She gained what sheâ€™s supposed to. She looked great, she felt good, she worked as much as she couldâ€  â€”   at least three,   shifts a week until late into her ninth month. Larry, a doctor, helped monitor her blood pressure at home, and all was normal. On her days off she got organized, picking out strollers and car seats, stocking up on diapers and onesies. After one last   vacation to the Caribbean, she and Larry went hunting for their forever home, settling on a brick colonial with black shutters and a big yard in Moorestown, N. J. not far from his new job as an orthopedic trauma surgeon in Camden. Lauren wanted the babyâ€™s gender to be a surprise, so when she set up the nursery she left the walls unpainted  â€”   she figured sheâ€™d have plenty of time to choose colors later. Despite all she knew about what could go wrong, she seemed untroubled by the normal   anxieties. Her only real worry was going into labor prematurely. â€You have to stay in there at least until 32 weeks,â€ she would tell her belly. â€I see how the babies do before 32. Just donâ€™t come out too soon.â€ When she reached 39 weeks and six days  â€”   Friday, Sept. 30, 2011  â€”   Larry and Lauren drove to Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, the hospital where the two of them had met in 2004 and where sheâ€™d spent virtually her entire career. If anyone would watch out for her and her baby, Lauren figured, it would be the doctors and nurses she worked with on a daily basis. She was especially fond of her   who had trained as a resident at Monmouth at the same time as Larry. Lauren wasnâ€™t having contractions, but she and the   agreed to schedule an induction of labor  â€”   he was on call that weekend and would be sure to handle the delivery himself. Inductions often go slowly, and Laurenâ€™s labor stretched well into the next day. Ennis talked to her on the phone several times: â€She said she was feeling OK, she was just really uncomfortable.â€ At one point, Lauren was overcome by a sudden, sharp pain in her back near her kidneys or liver, but the nurses bumped up her epidural and the stabbing stopped. Inductions have been associated with higher   rates, but Lauren progressed well enough to deliver vaginally. On Saturday, Oct. 1, at 6:49 p. m. 23 hours after she checked into the hospital, Hailey Anne Bloomstein was born, weighing 5 pounds, 12 ounces. Larry and Laurenâ€™s family had been camped out in the waiting room now they swarmed into the delivery area to ooh and aah, marveling at how Lauren seemed to glow. Larry floated around on his own cloud of euphoria, phone camera in hand. In one   video, Lauren holds their daughter on her chest, stroking her cheek with a practiced touch. Hailey is bundled in   pastels and flannel, unusually alert for a newborn she studies her motherâ€™s face as if trying to make sense of a mystery that will never be solved. The delivery room staff bustles in the background in the   way of people who believe everything has gone exactly as itâ€™s supposed to. Then Lauren looks directly at the camera, her eyes brimming. Twenty hours later, she was dead. â€We donâ€™t pay enough attentionâ€  The ability to protect the health of mothers and babies in childbirth is a basic measure of a societyâ€™s development. Yet every year in the U. S. 700 to 900 women die from pregnancy or   causes, and some 65, 000 nearly die  â€”   by many measures, the worst record in the developed world. American women are more than three times as likely as Canadian women to die in the maternal period (defined by the Centers for Disease Control as the start of pregnancy to one year after delivery or termination) six times as likely to die as Scandinavians. In every other wealthy country, and many less affluent ones, maternal mortality rates have been falling in Great Britain, the journal Lancet recently noted, the rate has declined so dramatically that â€a man is more likely to die while his partner is pregnant than she is.â€ But in the U. S. maternal deaths increased from 2000 to 2014. In a recent analysis by the CDC Foundation, nearly 60 percent of such deaths are preventable. While maternal mortality is significantly more common among     women and in rural areas, pregnancy and childbirth complications kill women of every race and ethnicity, education and income level, in every part of the U. S. ProPublica and NPR spent the last several months scouring social media and other sources, ultimately identifying more than 450 expectant and new mothers who have died since 2011. The list includes teachers, insurance brokers, homeless women, journalists, a spokeswoman for Yellowstone National Park, a   of the YouTube channel WhatsUpMoms, and more than a dozen doctors and nurses like Lauren Bloomstein. They died from cardiomyopathy and other heart problems, massive hemorrhage, blood clots, infections and   hypertension (preeclampsia) as well as rarer causes. Many died days or weeks after leaving the hospital. Maternal mortality is commonplace enough that three new mothers who died, including Lauren, were cared for by the same  . The reasons for higher maternal mortality in the U. S. are manifold. New mothers are older than they used to be, with more complex medical histories. Half of pregnancies in the U. S. are unplanned, so many women donâ€™t address chronic health issues beforehand. Greater prevalence of   leads to more   complications. The fragmented health system makes it harder for new mothers, especially those without good insurance, to get the care they need. Confusion about how to recognize worrisome symptoms and treat obstetric emergencies makes caregivers more prone to error. Yet the worsening U. S. maternal mortality numbers contrast sharply with the impressive progress in saving babiesâ€™ lives. Infant mortality has fallen to its lowest point in history, the CDC reports, reflecting 50 years of efforts by the public health community to prevent birth defects, reduce preterm birth, and improve outcomes for very premature infants. The number of babies who die annually in the U. S"
164570,300,secondary,1,"â€”   about 23, 000 in 2014  â€”   still greatly exceeds the number of expectant and new mothers who die, but the ratio is narrowing. The divergent trends for mothers and babies highlight a theme that has emerged repeatedly in ProPublicaâ€™s and NPRâ€™s reporting. In recent decades, under the assumption that it had conquered maternal mortality, the American medical system has focused more on fetal and infant safety and survival than on the motherâ€™s health and  . â€We worry a lot about vulnerable little babies,â€ said Barbara Levy, vice president for health   at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and a member of the Council on Patient Safety in Womenâ€™s Health Care. Meanwhile, â€we donâ€™t pay enough attention to those things that can be catastrophic for women.â€ At the federally funded   Medicine Units Network, the preeminent obstetric research collaborative in the U. S. only four of the 34 initiatives listed in its online database primarily target mothers, versus 24 aimed at improving outcomes for infants (the remainder address both). Under the Title V   program supporting maternal and child health, states devoted about 6 percent of block grants in 2016 to programs for mothers, compared to 78 percent for infants and   children. The notion that babies deserve more care than mothers is similarly enshrined in the Medicaid program, which pays for about 45 percent of births. In many states, the program covers moms for 60 days postpartum, their infants for a full year. The bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, adopted by the U. S. House of Representatives earlier this month, could gut Medicaid for mothers and babies alike. At the provider level, advances in technology have widened the gap between maternal and fetal and infant care. â€People became really enchanted with the ability to do ultrasound, and then   ultrasound, to do invasive procedures, to stick needles in the amniotic cavity,â€ said William Callaghan chief of the CDCâ€™s Maternal and Infant Health Branch. The growing specialty of   medicine drifted so far toward care of the fetus that as recently as 2012, young doctors who wanted to work in the field didnâ€™t have to spend time learning to care for birthing mothers. â€The training was quite variable across the U. S.,â€ said Mary Dâ€™Alton, chair of   at Columbia University Medical Center and author of papers on disparities in care for mothers and infants. â€There were some fellows that could finish their   medicine training without ever being in a labor and delivery unit.â€ In the last decade or so, at least 20 hospitals have established multidisciplinary fetal care centers for babies at high risk for a variety of problems. So far, only one hospital in the U. S"
164570,301,tertiary,128,"â€”       â€”   has a similar program for     . In regular maternity wards, too, babies are monitored more closely than mothers during and after birth, maternal health advocates told ProPublica and NPR. Newborns in the slightest danger are whisked off to neonatal intensive care units like the one Lauren Bloomstein worked at, staffed by highly trained specialists ready for the worst, while their mothers are tended by nurses and doctors who expect things to be fine and are often unprepared when they arenâ€™t. When women are discharged, they routinely receive information about how to   and what to do if their newborn is sick but not necessarily how to tell if they need medical attention themselves. â€It was only when I had my own child that I realized, â€™Oh my goodness. That was completely insufficient information,â€™â€ said Elizabeth Howell, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. â€The way that weâ€™ve been trained, we do not give women enough information for them to manage their health postpartum. The focus had always been on babies and not on mothers.â€ In 2009, the Joint Commission, which accredits 21, 000 health care facilities in the U. S. adopted a series of perinatal â€core measuresâ€  â€”   national standards that have been shown to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes. Four of the measures are aimed at making sure the baby is healthy. One  â€”   bringing down the   rate  â€”   addresses maternal health. Meanwhile,   practices that have become widely accepted in other affluent countries  â€”   and in a few states, notably California  â€”   have yet to take hold in many American hospitals. Take the example of preeclampsia, a type of high blood pressure that occurs only in pregnancy or the postpartum period, and can lead to seizures and strokes. Around the world, it kills an estimated five women an hour. But in developed countries, it is highly treatable. The key is to act quickly. By standardizing its approach, Britain has reduced preeclampsia deaths to one in a million  â€”   a total of two deaths from 2012 to 2014. In the U. S. on the other hand, preeclampsia still accounts for about 8 percent of maternal deaths â€”   50 to 70 women a year. Including Lauren Bloomstein. â€I cannot remember too many health care employees that I respect as much as Laurenâ€ When Lauren McCarthy Bloomstein was a teenager in the 1990s, a neighbor who worked for a New York publishing firm approached her about modeling for a series of books based on Louisa May Alcottâ€™s classic Little Women. Since her motherâ€™s death, Lauren had become solitary and shy she loved to read, but she decided she wasnâ€™t interested. â€Are you kidding? Go do it!â€ Frankie Hedges insisted. â€That would be fabulous!â€ Lauren relented, and the publisher cast her as the eldest March sister, Meg. She appeared on the covers of four books, looking very much the proper   young lady with her long brown hair parted neatly down the middle and a string of pearls around her neck. The determined expression on her face, though, was pure Lauren. â€She didnâ€™t want sympathy, she didnâ€™t want pity,â€ Jackie Ennis said. â€She wasnâ€™t one to talk much about her feelings [about] her mom. She looked at it as this is what she was dealt and sheâ€™s gonna do everything in her power to become a productive person.â€ In high school, Lauren decided her path lay in nursing, and she chose a   program at Brookdale Community College. She worked at a doctorâ€™s office to earn money for tuition and lived in the garage apartment that Hedges and her husband had converted especially for her, often helping out with their young twin sons. Lauren â€wasnâ€™t a real mushy person,â€ Hedges said. â€She wasnâ€™t the type to say things like â€™I love you. â€™â€ But she clearly relished being part of a family again. â€You canâ€™t believe how happy she is,â€ Ennis once told Hedges. â€Weâ€™ll be out and sheâ€™ll say, â€™Oh, I have to go home for dinner! â€™â€ After graduating in 2002, Lauren landed at Monmouth Medical Center, a sprawling   complex a few minutes from the ocean that is part of the RWJBarnabas Health system and a teaching affiliate of Philadelphiaâ€™s Drexel University College of Medicine. Her first job was in the medical surgical unit, where her clinical skills and work ethic soon won accolades. â€I cannot remember too many health care employees that I respect as much as Lauren,â€ Diane Stanaway, then Monmouthâ€™s clinical director of nursing, wrote in a 2005 commendation. â€What a dynamite young lady and nurse!â€ When a top hospital executive needed surgery, Larry recalled, he paid Lauren the ultimate compliment, picking her as one of two   nurses to help oversee his care. Larry Bloomstein, who joined the unit as an orthopedic surgical resident in 2004, was dazzled, too. He liked her independent streak  â€”   â€she didnâ€™t feel the need to rely on anyone else for anythingâ€  â€”   and her  . Even performing CPR on a dying patient, Lauren â€had a calmness about her,â€ Larry said. He thought her tough upbringing â€gave her a sense of confidence. She didnâ€™t seem to worry about small things.â€ Lauren, meanwhile, told Ennis, â€I met this guy. Heâ€™s a doctor, and heâ€™s very kind.â€ Their first date was a Bruce Springsteen concert five years later they married on Long Beach Island, on the Jersey shore. One of Laurenâ€™s favorite books was Catcher in the Rye  â€”   â€she related to the Holden Caulfield character rescuing kids,â€ Larry said. When a spot opened at Monmouthâ€™s elite neonatal intensive care unit in 2006, she jumped at it. The hospital has the   maternity department in the state, delivering 5, 449 babies in 2016. Monmouth earned an â€Aâ€ grade from Leapfrog, a nonprofit that promotes safety in health care, and met full safety standards in critical areas of maternity care, such as rates of   and early elective deliveries, a hospital spokeswoman said. Its NICU, a Level III facility for   newborns, is the oldest in New Jersey. â€With NICU nursing, itâ€™s one of those things either you get it or you donâ€™t,â€ said Katy DiBernardo, a   veteran of the unit. â€The babies are little, and a lot of people arenâ€™t used to seeing a teeny tiny baby.â€ The NICU staff included nurses, neonatologists, a respiratory therapist, and residents. Lauren, DiBernardo said, â€just clicked.â€ One of the things Lauren liked best about her work was the bonds she formed with babiesâ€™ families. Nurses followed the same newborns throughout their stay, sometimes for weeks or months. She was a touchstone for parents  â€”   very good at â€calming people down who have a lot of anxiety,â€ Larry said  â€”   and often stayed in contact long after the babies went home, meeting the moms for coffee and even babysitting on occasion. She also cherished the deep friendships that a place like the NICU forged. The neonatal floor was like a world unto itself, Lauren Byron, another   nurse there, explained: â€Thereâ€™s a lot of stress and pressure, and you are in    situations. You develop a very close relationship with some people.â€ The environment tended to attract very strong personalities. Laurenâ€™s nickname in the Bloomstein family football pool was â€The Feisty One,â€ so she fit right in. But she could stand her ground without alienating anyone. â€She was one of those people that everyone liked,â€ Byron said. â€We save more than we loseâ€ Another person everyone liked was   John Vaclavik. He had come to Monmouth as a resident in 2004, around the same time as Larry, after earning his bachelorâ€™s from Loyola College in Baltimore and his medical degree at St. Georgeâ€™s University on the island of Grenada. Medicine was the family profession: two uncles and two brothers also became doctors and his wife was a perinatal social worker at the hospital. Lauren and her colleagues thought he was â€very personableâ€ and â€a great guy,â€ Larry said. â€She was good friends with my wife and she felt comfortable with me,â€ Vaclavik would recall in a 2015 court deposition. After his residency, Vaclavik joined Ocean Obstetric  Gynecologic Associates, a thriving practice that counted numerous medical professionals among its clients. Vaclavik was a â€laboristâ€  â€”   part of a movement that aimed to reduce the number of   which tend to have more difficult recoveries and more complications than vaginal births. In a state with a   rate of 37 percent, Monmouthâ€™s rate in 2016 was just 21 percent. The neonatal nurses had plenty of opportunity to observe Vaclavik and other   in action  â€”   someone from NICU was called to attend every delivery that showed signs of being complicated or unusual as well as every  . â€We always laughed, â€™Theyâ€™ll call us for a hangnail,â€™â€ DiBernardo said. Lauren was so impressed by Vaclavik that she not only chose him as her own doctor, she recommended him to her best friend. â€She kept saying, â€™You have to go to this guy. Heâ€™s a good doctor. Good doctor,â€™â€ Ennis said. In other ways, though, the NICU staff and the labor and delivery staff were very separate. The neonatal nurses were focused on their own fragile patients  â€”   the satisfaction that came from helping them grow strong enough to go home, the grief when that didnâ€™t happen. Once Ennis asked Lauren, â€How do you deal with babies that donâ€™t make it? Thatâ€™s got to be so bad.â€ Lauren replied, â€Yeah, but we save more than we lose.â€ Loss was less common in labor and delivery, and when a new mother suffered   complications, the news did not always reach the NICU floor. Thus, when a    special education teacher named Tara Hansen contracted a grisly infection a few days after giving birth to her first child in March 2011, the tragedy didnâ€™t register with Lauren, who was then three months pregnant herself. Hansen lived in nearby Freehold, N. J. with her husband, Ryan, her high school sweetheart. Her pregnancy, like Laurenâ€™s, had been textbook perfect and she delivered a healthy   son. But Hansen suffered tearing near her vagina during childbirth. She developed signs of infection but was discharged anyway, a lawsuit by her husband later alleged. Hansen was soon readmitted to Monmouth with what the lawsuit called â€excruciating, severe pain beyond the capacity of a human being to endure.â€ The diagnosis was necrotizing fasciitis, commonly known as   bacteria two days later Hansen was dead. One of Vaclavikâ€™s colleagues delivered Hansenâ€™s baby Vaclavik himself authorized her discharge. According to court documents, he said nurses failed to inform him about Hansenâ€™s symptoms and that if heâ€™d known her vital signs werenâ€™t stable, he wouldnâ€™t have released her. The hospital and nurses eventually settled for $1. 5 million. The suit against Vaclavik and his colleagues is pending"
164570,302,tertiary,44," Vaclavik did not respond to several interview requests from ProPublica and NPR, including an emailed list of questions. â€Due to the fact this matter is in litigation,â€ his attorney responded, â€Dr. Vaclavik respectfully declines to comment.â€   Citing patient privacy, Monmouth spokeswoman Elizabeth Brennan also declined to discuss specific cases. â€We are saddened by the grief these families have experienced from their loss,â€ she said in a statement. â€I donâ€™t feel goodâ€ Larry Bloomsteinâ€™s first inkling that something was seriously wrong with Lauren came about 90 minutes after she gave birth. He had accompanied Hailey up to the nursery to be weighed and measured and given the usual barrage of tests for newborns. Lauren hadnâ€™t eaten since breakfast, but he returned to find her dinner tray untouched. â€I donâ€™t feel good,â€ she told him. She pointed to a spot above her abdomen and just below her sternum, close to where sheâ€™d felt the stabbing sensation during labor. â€Iâ€™ve got pain thatâ€™s coming back.â€ Larry had been at Laurenâ€™s side much of the previous 24 hours. Conscious that his role was husband rather than doctor, he had tried not to overstep. Now, though, he pressed Vaclavik: What was the matter with his wife? â€He was like, â€™I see this a lot. We do a lot of belly surgery. This is definitely reflux,â€™â€ Larry recalled. According to Laurenâ€™s records, the   ordered an antacid called Bicitra and an opioid painkiller called Dilaudid. Lauren vomited them up. Laurenâ€™s pain was soon 10 on a scale of 10, she told Larry and the nurses so excruciating, the nurses noted, â€Patient [is] unable to stay still.â€ Just as ominously, her blood pressure was spiking. An hour after Haileyâ€™s birth, the reading was   an hour after that,  . At her final prenatal appointment, her reading had been just  . Obstetrics wasnâ€™t Larryâ€™s specialty, but he knew enough to ask the nurse: Could this be preeclampsia? Preeclampsia, or   hypertension, is a   condition that affects 3 percent to 5 percent of expectant or new mothers in the U. S. up to 200, 000 women a year. It can strike anyone out of the blue, though the risk is higher for   women with   conditions such as obesity, diabetes or kidney disease, and mothers over the age of 40. It is most common during the second half of pregnancy, but can develop in the days or weeks after childbirth, and can become very dangerous very quickly. Because a traditional treatment for preeclampsia is to deliver as soon as possible, the babies are often premature and end up in NICUs like the one where Lauren worked. As Larry suspected, Laurenâ€™s blood pressure readings were well past the danger point. What he didnâ€™t know was that theyâ€™d been abnormally high since she entered the hospital  â€”     according to her admissions paperwork. During labor, she had 21 systolic readings at or above 140 and 13 diastolic readings at or above 90, her records indicated for a stretch of almost eight hours, her blood pressure wasnâ€™t monitored at all, the New Jersey Department of Health later found. Over that same period, her babyâ€™s vital signs were being constantly watched, Larry said. In his court deposition, Vaclavik described the   reading as â€elevatedâ€ compared to her usual readings, but not abnormal. He â€would use 180 over 110 as a cutoffâ€ to suspect preeclampsia, he said. Still, he acknowledged, Laurenâ€™s blood pressure â€might have been recommended to be monitored more closely, in retrospect.â€ Leading medical organizations in the U. S. and the U. K. take a different view. They advise that increases to   for pregnant women with no previous history of high blood pressure signify preeclampsia. When systolic readings hit 160, treatment with   drugs and magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures â€should be initiated ASAP,â€ according to guidelines from the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health. When other symptoms, such as upper abdominal (epigastric) pain, are present, the situation is considered even more urgent"
164570,303,primary,158,"This basic approach isnâ€™t new: â€Core Curriculum for   Nursing,â€ a widely used textbook, outlined it in 1997. Yet failure to diagnose preeclampsia, or to differentiate it from chronic high blood pressure, is all too common. California researchers who studied preeclampsia deaths over several years found one striking theme: â€Despite triggers that clearly indicated a serious deterioration in the patientâ€™s condition, health care providers failed to recognize and respond to these signs in a timely manner, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.â€ Preeclampsia symptoms  â€”   swelling and rapid weight gain, gastric discomfort and vomiting, headache and anxiety  â€”   are often mistaken for the normal irritations that crop up during pregnancy or after giving birth. â€We donâ€™t have a   test for it,â€ said Eleni Tsigas, executive director of the Preeclampsia Foundation. â€A lot of physicians donâ€™t necessarily see a lot of it.â€ Outdated notions  â€”   for example, that delivering the baby cures the condition  â€”   unfamiliarity with best practices and lack of crisis preparation can further hinder the response. The fact that Lauren gave birth over the weekend may also have worked against her. Hospitals may be staffed differently on weekends, adding to the challenges of managing a crisis. A new Baylor College of Medicine analysis of 45 million pregnancies in the U. S. from 2004 to 2014 found mothers who deliver on Saturday or Sunday have nearly 50 percent higher mortality rates as well as more blood transfusions and more perineal tearing. The â€weekend effectâ€ has also been associated with higher fatality rates from heart attacks, strokes and head trauma. According to Laurenâ€™s records, Vaclavik did order a preeclampsia lab test around 8:40 p. m. but a nurse noted a   later: â€No abnormal labs present.â€ (According to Larry, the results were borderline.) Larry began pushing to call in a specialist. Vaclavik attributed Laurenâ€™s pain to esophagitis, or inflammation of the esophagus, which had afflicted her before, he said in his deposition. Around 10 p. m. according to Laurenâ€™s medical records, he phoned the   gastroenterologist, who ordered an   and additional tests, more Dilaudid and different antacids  â€”   Maalox and Protonix. Nothing helped. Meanwhile, Larry decided to reach out to his own colleagues in the trauma unit at Cooper University Hospital in Camden. In his training, perhaps the most important lesson heâ€™d learned was to ask for help: â€If thereâ€™s a problem, I will immediately get another physician involved.â€ By chance, the doctor on call happened to be a fairly new mother. As Larry described Laurenâ€™s symptoms, she interrupted him. â€You can stop talking. I know what this is.â€ She said Lauren had HELLP syndrome, an acronym for the most severe variation of preeclampsia, characterized by hemolysis, or the breakdown of red blood cells elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count, a clotting deficiency that can lead to excessive bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. Larryâ€™s colleague urged him to stop wasting time, he recalled. Laurenâ€™s very high blood pressure, the vomiting, and the terrible pain radiating from her kidneys and liver were symptoms of rapid deterioration. â€Your wifeâ€™s in a lot of danger,â€ the trauma doctor said. (She didnâ€™t respond to ProPublicaâ€™s and NPRâ€™s requests for comment.) â€Itâ€™s never just one thingâ€ Earlier this year, an analysis by the CDC Foundation of maternal mortality data from four states identified more than 20 â€critical factorsâ€ that contributed to   deaths. Among the ones involving providers: lack of standardized policies, inadequate clinical skills, failure to consult specialists and poor coordination of care. The average maternal death had 3. 7 critical factors. â€Itâ€™s never just one thing,â€ said Roberta Gold, a member of the Council on Patient Safety in Womenâ€™s Health Care, whose daughter and unborn grandson died from a   blood clot in 2010. â€Itâ€™s always a cascading combination of things. Itâ€™s a   train wreck.â€ The last 16 hours of Laurenâ€™s life were consistent with that grim pattern. Distressed by what the trauma doctor had told him, Larry immediately went to Laurenâ€™s caregivers. But they insisted the tests didnâ€™t show preeclampsia, he said. Not long after, Larryâ€™s colleague called back to check on Laurenâ€™s condition. â€I donâ€™t believe those labs,â€ he recalls her telling him. â€They canâ€™t be right. Iâ€™m positive of my diagnosis. Do them again. â€™â€ Meanwhile, Laurenâ€™s agony had become almost unendurable. The blood pressure cuff on her arm was adding to her discomfort, so around 10:30 p. m. her nurse decided to remove it  â€”   on the theory, Larry said, â€We know her blood pressure is high. Thereâ€™s no point to retaking it.â€ According to Laurenâ€™s records, her blood pressure went unmonitored for another hour and 44 minutes. Larry had given up on getting a specialist to come to the hospital so late on a Saturday night, but he persuaded Vaclavik to call in a general surgical resident. Around 11:55 p. m. according to the nursesâ€™ notes, Lauren begged, â€Do anything to stop this pain.â€ Vaclavik prescribed morphine, to little effect. Just after midnight, her blood pressure about to peak at   Lauren began complaining of a headache. As Larry studied his wifeâ€™s face, he realized something had changed. â€She suddenly looks really calm and comfortable, like sheâ€™s trying to go to sleep.â€ She gave Larry a little smile, but only the right side of her mouth moved. In an instant, Larryâ€™s alarm turned to panic. He ordered Lauren, â€Lift your hands for me.â€ Only her right arm fluttered. He peeled off her blankets and scraped the soles of her feet with his fingernail, testing her   Babinski reflex in an adult whose brain is working normally, the big toe automatically jerks downward. Laurenâ€™s right toe curled as it was supposed to. But her left toe stuck straight out, unmoving. As Larry was examining her, Lauren suddenly seemed to realize what was happening to her. â€She looked at me and said, â€™Iâ€™m afraid,â€™ and, â€™I love you.â€™ And Iâ€™m pretty sure in that moment she put the pieces together. That she had a conscious awareness of . .. that she was not going to make it.â€ A CT scan soon confirmed the worst: The escalating blood pressure had triggered bleeding in her brain"
164570,304,primary,48," hemorrhagic strokes tend to be deadlier than those caused by blood clots. Surgery can sometimes save the patientâ€™s life, but only if it is performed quickly"
164570,305,tertiary,141,"Larry was a realist he knew that even the   scenario was devastating. Chances were that Lauren would be paralyzed or partially paralyzed. Sheâ€™d never be the mother she had dreamed of being. Sheâ€™d never be a nurse again. But at least there was a chance she would live. When the neurologist arrived, Larry asked, â€Is there hope here?â€ As he recalls it, the neurologist responded, â€Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here. Thereâ€™s hope.â€ Larry began gathering Laurenâ€™s loved ones  â€”   his parents, her brother, Frankie Hedges and her husband Billy, Jackie Ennis. On the phone, he tried to play down the gravity of the situation, but everyone understood. When Larryâ€™s mother arrived, the hospital entrance was locked, and Larry and Vaclavik came to meet her. â€The obstetrician just said, â€™Sheâ€™s going to be all right,â€™â€ Linda Bloomstein said. â€And Larry was standing behind him, and I saw the tears coming down, and he was shaking his head, â€™No. â€™â€ Around 2 a. m. the neurosurgeon finally confirmed what the trauma doctor had said four hours before: Lauren had HELLP syndrome. Then he delivered more bad news: Her blood platelets  â€”   essential to stopping the hemorrhage  â€”   were dangerously low. But, according to Larry, the hospital didnâ€™t have sufficient platelets on site, so her surgery would have to be delayed. Larry was dumbfounded. How could a regional medical center that delivered babies and performed all types of surgery not have platelets on hand for an emergency? Vaclavik called the Red Cross and other facilities, pleading with them to send any they had. â€In my understanding, there was a complete shortage of platelets in the state of New Jersey,â€ he said in the deposition. Hours passed before the needed platelets arrived. The neuro team did another CT scan around 6 a. m. Larry couldnâ€™t bring himself to look at it, â€but from what theyâ€™ve told me, it was horrifically worse.â€ While Lauren was in surgery, friends began dropping by, hoping to see her and the baby, not realizing what had happened since her cheerful texts the night before. Around 12:30 p. m. the neurosurgeon emerged and confirmed that brain activity had stopped. Lauren was on life support, with no chance of recovery. All this time, Hailey had been in the newborn nursery, being tended by Laurenâ€™s stunned colleagues. They brought her down to Laurenâ€™s room and Larry placed her gently into her motherâ€™s arms. After a few minutes, the nurses whisked the baby back up to the third floor to protect her from germs. A respiratory therapist carefully removed the breathing tube from Laurenâ€™s mouth. At 3:08 p. m. surrounded by her loved ones, she died. A private tragedy, In the U. S. unlike some other developed countries, maternal deaths are treated as a private tragedy rather than as a public health catastrophe. A death in childbirth may be mourned on Facebook or memorialized on GoFundMe, but it is rarely reported in the news. Most obituaries, Laurenâ€™s included, donâ€™t mention how a mother died. Laurenâ€™s passing was more public than most, eliciting an outpouring of grief. Hundreds of people attended her wake and funeral  â€”   doctors and nurses from the hospital, friends from around the country, families Lauren had taken care of. Vaclavik was there, utterly devastated, Larryâ€™s family said. The head of Monmouthâ€™s   department paid his respects and, according to Larry, promised in a private conversation at the wake to conduct a full investigation. In the days after Laurenâ€™s death, Larry couldnâ€™t dwell on the implications of what had happened. He had to find a burial plot, choose a casket, write a eulogy. He was too shattered to return to the Mooresville house, so he took Hailey to his parentsâ€™ place, a   apartment they were renting while they renovated their home, and slept with the baby in the living room for the first month. After the funeral, he turned all his attention to his daughter. He knew nothing about newborns, always imagining Lauren would teach him  â€”   â€What could be better than having your own NICU nurse to take care of your baby?â€ he had thought. He relied on his mother and sister and Laurenâ€™s friends to guide him. He took time off from his job at Cooper, figuring three months would be enough. But as his return date approached, he knew he wasnâ€™t ready. â€I donâ€™t think I can see a patient thatâ€™s on a ventilator right now,â€ he realized. â€Or even just a hospital bed.â€ He didnâ€™t want to leave Hailey. So he quit. He sold the house, though he couldnâ€™t bring himself to attend the closing  â€”   â€I couldnâ€™t stand handing those keys over to someone else.â€ He took Hailey a couple of times to stay with his sister and her family in Texas, where he didnâ€™t have to answer the constant questions. But traveling with his baby daughter was painful in its own way. People didnâ€™t know what to make of him. â€Itâ€™s strange for people to see a father alone,â€ he said. Wherever he went, he felt disconnected from almost everything around him: â€Youâ€™re walking around this world and all these people are around you, and theyâ€™re going on with their lives and I just felt very, very isolated and very alone with that.â€ Back in New Jersey, Larry found a job closer to his parentsâ€™ place, performed one operation and tried to quit. His new employers, though, persuaded him to stay. To avoid reliving the funeral, he returned to Texas for the first anniversary of Haileyâ€™s birth and Laurenâ€™s death in late September 2012. In one of his suitcases, he packed a giant cupcake mold Lauren had bought when they first married  â€”   she thought it would make a perfect   cake for the kids she yearned for. He baked the cake himself  â€”   chocolate, Laurenâ€™s favorite, covered with sprinkles. â€With our technology, every single time a woman dies, itâ€™s a medical errorâ€ Other people in Laurenâ€™s and Larryâ€™s circle had been asking questions about her care since the night she died. â€That was the first thing I literally said when I walked [into the hospital]  â€”   I said, â€™How did this happen? â€™â€ Jackie Ennis recalled. In the next week or two, she probed Larry again: â€â€™Did they do everything they could for her? â€™â€ He said, â€™No, there were warning signs for hours before. â€™â€ Ennis was too upset to dig any deeper. As Larryâ€™s numbness wore off, his orthopedist friends began pushing him as well. Larry was hesitant despite the missteps he had witnessed, part of him wanted to believe that Laurenâ€™s death had been unavoidable. â€And my friends were like, â€™We canâ€™t accept that . .. With our technology, every single time a woman dies [in childbirth] itâ€™s a medical error. â€™â€ Laurenâ€™s death, Larry finally admitted to himself, could not be dismissed as either inevitable or a fluke. He had seen how Laurenâ€™s   and nurses had failed to recognize a textbook case of one of the most common complications of pregnancy  â€”   not once, but repeatedly over two days. To Larry, the fact that someone with Laurenâ€™s advantages could die so needlessly was symptomatic of a bigger problem. By some measures, New Jersey had one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the U. S. He wanted authorities to get to the root of it  â€”   to push the people and institutions that were at fault to change. Thatâ€™s the approach in the United Kingdom, where maternal deaths are regarded as systems failures. A national committee of experts scrutinizes every death of a woman from pregnancy or childbirth complications, collecting medical records and assessments from caregivers, conducting rigorous analyses of the data, and publishing reports that help set policy for hospitals throughout the country. Coroners also sometimes hold public inquests, forcing hospitals and their staffs to answer for their mistakes. The U. K. process is largely responsible for the stunning reduction in preeclampsia deaths in Britain, the committee noted its 2016 report  â€”   â€a clear success storyâ€ that it hoped to repeat â€across other medical and mental health causes of maternal death.â€ The U. S. has no comparable federal effort. Instead, maternal mortality reviews are left up to states. As of this spring, 26 states (and one city, Philadelphia) had a   process in place another five states had committees that were less than a year old. In almost every case, resources are tight, the reviews take years, and the findings get little attention. A bipartisan bill in Congress, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2017, would authorize funding for states to establish review panels or improve their processes. New Jerseyâ€™s review team, the   in the U. S. includes   nurses, mental health specialists, medical examiners, even a nutritionist. Using vital records and other reports, they identify every woman in New Jersey who died within a year of pregnancy or childbirth, from any cause, then review medical and other records to determine whether the death was â€ â€ or not. Every few years, the committee publishes a report, focusing on things like the race and age of the mothers who died, the causes of death, and other demographic and health data. In the past, the findings have been used to promote policies to reduce postpartum depression. But the New Jersey committee doesnâ€™t interview the relatives of the deceased, nor does it assess whether a death was preventable. Moreover, like every other state that conducts such reviews, New Jersey â€ â€ the records  â€”   strips them of any information that might point to an individual hospital or a particular woman. Otherwise, the medical community and lawmakers would refuse to go along. The goal is to â€improve care for patients in general,â€ said Joseph Apuzzio, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at   Jersey Medical School who heads the committee. This requires a process that is â€nonjudgmentalâ€ and â€not punitive,â€ he said. â€Thatâ€™s the best way to get a free discussion of all of the health care providers who are in the room.â€ Yet the result of   as Larry soon realized, is that the review is of little use in assigning responsibility for individual deaths, or evaluating whether some hospitals, doctors or nurses are more prone to error than others. To Larry, this seemed like a critical oversight  â€”   or perhaps, willful denial. In a preventable death or other medical error, he said, sometimes the who and the where are as important as the why. â€Unless someone points the finger specifically,â€ he said, â€I think the actual cause [of the problem] is lost.â€ â€The facility is not in complianceâ€ Someone eventually steered Larry toward the New Jersey Department of Healthâ€™s licensing and inspection division, which oversees hospital and   safety. He filed a complaint against Monmouth Medical Center in 2012. The DOH examined Laurenâ€™s records, interviewed her caregivers and scrutinized Monmouthâ€™s policies and practices. In December 2012 it issued a report that backed up everything Larry had seen  . â€There is no record in the medical record that the Registered Nurse notified [the  ] of the elevated blood pressures of patient prior to delivery,â€ investigators found. And: â€There is no evidence in the medical record of further evaluation and surveillance of patient from [the  ] prior to delivery.â€ And: â€There was no evidence in the medical record that the elevated blood pressures were addressed by [the  ] until after the Code Stroke was called.â€ The report faulted the hospital. â€The facility is not in complianceâ€ with New Jersey hospital licensing standards, it concluded. â€The facility failed to ensure that recommended obstetrics guidelines are adhered to by staff.â€ To address these criticisms, Monmouth Medical Center had implemented a plan of correction, also contained in the report. The plan called for a mandatory educational program for all labor and delivery nurses about preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome staff training in Advance Life Support Obstetrics and Critical Care Obstetrics and more training on the use of   methods to assess patients and improve communications between caregivers. Some of the changes were strikingly basic: â€Staff nurses were educated regarding the necessity of reviewing, when available, or obtaining the patients [sic] prenatal records. Education identified that they must make a comparison of the prenatal blood pressure against the initial admission blood pressure.â€ And: â€Repeat vital signs will be obtained every 4 hours at a minimum.â€ An important part of the plan of correction involved Vaclavik, though neither he nor the nurses were identified by name. The head of Monmouthâ€™s   department provided â€professional remediation for the identified physician,â€ the Department of Health report said. In addition, there was â€monitoring of 100% of records for physician of record per month x 3 months.â€ The monitoring focused on â€compliance of timely physician intervention for elevated blood   assessment and management.â€ The department chairman, Robert Graebe, found Vaclavikâ€™s charts to be 100 percent compliant, Vaclavik said in the deposition. Graebe was asked in a March 2017 deposition if Vaclavik was in good standing at the hospital at the time of Laurenâ€™s treatment. â€Was and is,â€ Graebe replied. In a separate note, the Department of Health told Larry that it forwarded his complaint to the Board of Medical Examiners and the New Jersey Board of Nursing. Neither agency has taken disciplinary action, according to their websites. Larryâ€™s copy of the DOH report arrived in the mail. He was gratified by the findings but dismayed that they werenâ€™t publicly posted. That meant hardly anyone would see them. A few months after the DOH weighed in, he sued Monmouth, Vaclavik and five nurses in Monmouth County Superior Court in Freehold, N. J. For a medical malpractice lawsuit to go forward in New Jersey, an expert must certify that it has merit. Larryâ€™s passed muster with an  . But beyond the taking of depositions, thereâ€™s been little action in the case. Creating â€toolkitsâ€ As the maternal death rate has mounted around the U. S. a small cadre of reformers has mobilized. Some of the earliest and most important work has come in California, where more babies are born than in any other state  â€”  500, 000 a year,   of the U. S. total. Modeled on the U. K. process, the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative is informed by the experiences of founder Elliott Main, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford and the University of   Francisco, who for many years ran the   department at a San Francisco hospital. â€One of my saddest moments as an obstetrician was a woman with severe preeclampsia that we thought we had done everything correct, who still had a major stroke and we could not save her,â€ he said recently. That loss has weighed on him for 20 years. â€When youâ€™ve had a maternal death, you remember it for the rest of your life. All the details.â€ Launched a decade ago, CMQCC aims to reduce not only mortality, but also   complications and racial disparities in obstetric care. It began by analyzing maternal deaths in the state over several years in almost every case, it discovered, there was â€at least some chance to alter the outcome.â€ The most preventable deaths were from hemorrhage (70 percent) and preeclampsia (60 percent). Main and his colleagues then began creating a series of â€toolkitsâ€ to help doctors and nurses improve their handling of emergencies. The first one, targeting obstetric bleeding, recommended things like â€hemorrhage cartsâ€ for storing medications and supplies, crisis protocols for massive transfusions, and regular training and drills. Instead of the common practice of â€ â€ blood loss, which often leads to underestimating the seriousness of a hemorrhage and delaying treatment, nurses learned to collect and weigh postpartum blood to get precise measurements. Hospitals that adopted the toolkit saw a 21 percent decrease in near deaths from maternal bleeding in the first year hospitals that didnâ€™t use the protocol had a 1. 2 percent reduction. By 2013, according to Main, maternal deaths in California fell to around 7 per 100, 000 births, similar to the numbers in Canada, France and the Netherlands  â€”   a dramatic counter to the trends in other parts of the U. S. â€Prevention isnâ€™t a magic pill,â€ Main said. â€Itâ€™s actually teamwork [and having] a structured, organized, standardized approachâ€ to care. CMQCCâ€™s preeclampsia toolkit, launched in 2014, emphasized the kind of practices that might have saved Lauren Bloomstein: careful monitoring of blood pressure and early and aggressive treatment with magnesium sulfate and   medications. Data on its effectiveness hasnâ€™t been published. The collaborativeâ€™s work has inspired ACOG and advocates in a few states to create their own initiatives. Much of the funding has come from a   $500 million maternal health initiative by Merck, the pharmaceutical giant. Originally intended to focus on less developed countries, Merck for Mothers decided it couldnâ€™t ignore the growing problem in the U. S. The U. S. maternal mortality rate is â€unacceptable,â€ said executive director   Etiebet. Making pregnancy and childbirth safer â€will not only save womenâ€™s lives but will improve and strengthen our health systems . .. for all.â€ But the really hard work is only beginning. According to the Institute of Medicine, it takes an average of 17 years for a new medical protocol to be widely adopted. Even in California, half of the 250 hospitals that deliver babies still arenâ€™t using the toolkits, said Main, who largely blames inertia. In New York State, some hospitals have questioned the need for what they call â€cookbook medicine,â€ said Columbiaâ€™s Dâ€™Alton. Her response: â€Variability is the enemy of safety. Rather than have 10 different approaches to obstetric hemorrhage or treatment of hypertension, choose one or two and make it consistent . .. When we do things in a standardized way, we have better outcomes.â€ One big hurdle: training. Another: money. Smaller providers, in particular, may not see the point. â€Itâ€™s very hard to get a hospital to provide resources to change something that they donâ€™t see as a problem,â€ ACOGâ€™s Barbara Levy said. â€If they havenâ€™t had a maternal death because they only deliver 500 babies a year, how many years is it going to be before they see a severe problem? It may be 10 years.â€ In New Jersey, providers donâ€™t need as much convincing, thanks to a recent project to reduce postpartum blood loss led by the Association of Womenâ€™s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. A number of hospitals saw improvements at one, the average length of a   ICU stay plunged from 8 days to 1. 5 days. But only 31 of the stateâ€™s 52 birthing hospitals participated in the effort, in part  â€”   perhaps  â€”   because nurses led it, said Robyn Dâ€™Oria, executive director of the Central Jersey Family Health Consortium and member of the stateâ€™s maternal mortality committee. â€I remember having a conversation with [someone from] a hospital that I would describe as progressive and she said to me, â€™I cannot get past some of the physicians not wanting to buy into this. â€™â€ So New Jersey hospitals are about to try again, this time adopting   created by the   Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health for hemorrhage and preeclampsia. â€Weâ€™re at the very beginningâ€ of a   that is likely to take at least two years, Dâ€™Oria said. Among those helping create momentum has been Ryan Hansen, the husband of the teacher who died at Monmouth Medical Center a few months before Lauren Bloomstein. Still, as hospitals begin to revamp, mothers in the state continue to perish. One was Ashley Heaney Butler. A Rutgers University graduate, she lived in Bayville, where she decorated the walls of her house with anchors, reflecting her passion for the ocean. She worked for the state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services as a counselor, and served as president of the New Jersey Rehabilitation Association. Her husband Joseph was a firefighter. She gave birth at Monmouth last September to a healthy boy and died a couple of weeks later at the age of 31, never leaving the hospital. It turned out that she had developed an infection late in her pregnancy, possibly related to a prior gastric bypass surgery. She was under the care of several doctors, including Vaclavik. â€She didnâ€™t get what she deservedâ€ The sudden death of a new mother is tragic to everyone around her. â€When you take that one death and what that does, not only to the husband, but to the family and to the community, the impact that it has in the hospital, on the staff, on everybody thatâ€™s cared for her, on all the people who knew them, it has ripple effects for generations to come,â€ Robyn Dâ€™Oria said. Jackie Ennis felt Laurenâ€™s loss as an absence of phone calls. She and Lauren had been closer than many sisters, talking several times a day. Sometimes Lauren called just to say she was really tired and would talk later sheâ€™d even called Ennis from Hawaii on her honeymoon. The night Lauren died, Ennis knew something was wrong because she hadnâ€™t heard from her best friend. â€It took me a really long time not to get the phone calls,â€ she said. â€I still have trouble with that.â€ During Laurenâ€™s pregnancy, Frankie Hedges had thought of herself as Haileyâ€™s other grandmother. She and Lauren had made a lot of plans. Laurenâ€™s death meant the loss of their shared dreams for an entire extended family. â€I just feel she didnâ€™t get what she deserved,â€ Hedges said. Vaclavikâ€™s obstetric practice is â€largerâ€ than in 2011, and he continues to have admitting privileges at Monmouth and two other hospitals, he said in his deposition. â€I will never forgetâ€ Laurenâ€™s death, he said. â€. .. I probably suffer some post traumatic stress from this.â€ Hailey is 5 years old, with Laurenâ€™s brown hair and clear green eyes. She feels her motherâ€™s presence everywhere, thanks to Larry and his new wife Carolyn, whom he married in 2014. They met when she was a surgical tech at one of the hospitals he worked at after Lauren died. Photos and drawings of Lauren occupy the mantle of their home in Holmdel, the bookcase in the dining room, and the walls of the upstairs hallway. Larry and Carolyn and their other family members talk about Lauren freely, and even Larryâ€™s younger daughter,    Aria, calls her â€Mommy Lauren.â€ On birthdays and holidays, Larry takes the girls to the cemetery. He designed the gravestone  â€”   his handprint and Laurenâ€™s reaching away from each other, newborn Haileyâ€™s linking them forever. Larry has done his best to keep Laurenâ€™s extended family together  â€”   Ennis and Hedges and their families are included in every important celebration. Larry still has the video of Lauren and Hailey on his phone. â€By far the hardest thing for me to accept is [what happened] from Laurenâ€™s perspective,â€ he said one recent evening, hitting the play button and seeing her alive once more. â€I canâ€™t, I literally canâ€™t accept it. The amount of pain she must have experienced in that exact moment when she finally had this little girl . .. I can accept the amount of pain I have been dealt,â€ he went on, watching Lauren stroke Haileyâ€™s cheek. â€But [her pain] is the one thing I just canâ€™t accept. I canâ€™t understand, I canâ€™t fathom it.â€  NPRâ€™s Bo Erickson, and ProPublicaâ€™s research editor Derek Kravitz and engagement reporter Adriana Gallardo contributed to this report."
153105,306,secondary,41,"I grew up in a Kolkata flat across the road from Mother Teresaâ€™s convent. This was in the 1960s, before she was famous. I was one of many Catholic children who volunteered at Shishu Bhavan, her orphanage for abandoned children, feeding and bathing babies during the school holidays. It upset everyone greatly that the nuns were forbidden even a chilled juice on a sweltering summerâ€™s day. Absolutely nothing happened without Mother Teresaâ€™s permission. Young sisters walked miles in the scorching sun, often barefoot, on burning hot pavements, because Mother Teresa decreed it had to be done. A precocious    I hated this unfair, petty autocrat. Indian children were taught to respect their elders and revere the religious. In my teens, however, I met Marxist teachers who forced us to think critically about society and religion. So by the time I reached university I was in iconoclastic mode. I shunned the hypocrisy of many â€œpillarsâ€ of the church. Mother Teresa definitely helped the poor but her sisters were allowed to write home only twice a year, their personal letters scrutinised, sometimes by Mother Teresa herself. What a control freak, I raged. Mother Teresa didnâ€™t deserve Christopher Hitchenâ€™s unadulterated, poisonous vitriol. But her vintage, â€œThereâ€™s something beautiful in seeing the poor accept their lot, to suffer it like Christâ€™s Passion,â€ left me fuming too. How dare she trivialise poverty? But she could. She did. And the world lapped it up. She once comforted a sufferer, with the line: â€œYou are suffering, that means Jesus is kissing you. â€ The infuriated man screamed, â€œThen tell your Jesus to stop kissing me. â€ As a Christian in a Hindu majority country, such   often left me squirming with embarrassment. At 19, filled with youthful arrogance and   indignation, I questioned how she could ethically take money from the worldâ€™s most obnoxious dictators. Why was she silent about unjust wars and oppression? Later, when I had children, my mother insisted we took them to the her chapel to be blessed. She did. My mother told Mother Teresa, â€œMy daughters volunteered at Shishu Bhavan when they were young. â€ â€œOh,â€ she responded to me with unconcealed hauteur. â€œWhen you were a child. But now? You do nothing useful for the poor now, I suppose?â€ Stung by her rudeness, I felt the old anger rising. I stayed silent, not trusting myself to reply politely. â€œWe donâ€™t want her blessings,â€ I barked at my mother. â€œSheâ€™s even more insufferable now. â€ I carried this dislike in my heart for decades. A turning point came unexpectedly. Ten years ago, near the Mother House, I passed a man lying inert, on the Kolkata pavement. A drunk. I thought, moving past. Yet something made me stop and retrace my steps. Is he drunk or dead, I wondered. In the distance, I spotted two nuns in their distinctive blue and white saris. I ran towards them, â€œThereâ€™s a man lying on the roadside. Iâ€™m not sure if heâ€™s dead. â€ They responded immediately by helping him and calling an ambulance. Yes, Kolkata still has people dying abandoned on its streets. I was brought up to work for change, for social justice. But I cannot in conscience criticise a woman who picked people off filthy pavements to allow them to die in dignity. To my knowledge, thereâ€™s still no one else doing that. I am not particularly enamoured of sainthood. Or of Mother Teresa personally. But seeing her through the eyes of the man on the Kolkata street makes me pause. What would happen to these people if it werenâ€™t for the Teresas of this world reaching out to them in ways I certainly couldnâ€™t. Surely to them Mother Teresa must be a saint? Her home for the dying was Kolkataâ€™s first hospice. Maybe the question our society should ask is, â€œWhy do we still have a world where Mother Teresa is needed?â€ In answer to this, an Indian prayer floats through my mind. â€œWhere the mind is without fear and the head is held high, into that heaven of freedom my father, let my country awake. â€ These are not Mother Teresaâ€™s words but those of Indiaâ€™s most illustrious poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Saint Teresa imagined that such a world was possible."

Taser still gets the bulk of its revenue from its weapons, which use electrical current to immobilize targets. Last year, $202. 6 million of its $268. 2 million in revenue came from its weapons segment, mostly in the form of replacement cartridges. But Chief Executive Officer Rick Smith said the Taser brand name can be â€polarizingâ€ because of its association with the companyâ€™s weapons. The weapons are popular among police but have been criticized by groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, mainly because of deaths caused by Tasers. Taser will continue to use the Taser brand for its weapons products. The Axon brand will let the company market its cameras and records management software to police departments without the controversy the Taser brand can generate, Smith said. â€The thing we saw with Axon is that itâ€™s a less polarizing brand,â€ Smith told Reuters. â€Weâ€™re never going to run from Taser.

I hadnâ€™t been to a concert since I saw Miley Cyrus on her Bangerz tour in the same arena back in 2014. Both my friend and I (Iâ€™m 17, heâ€™s 18) are huge fans of Ariana   â€”   or Arianators, as weâ€™re known  â€”   and weâ€™d been looking forward to this since we bought tickets on   late last year. At 10:29 p. m. the show was just wrapping up. Ariana had just finished performing â€œDangerous Woman,â€ which was the final song. The atmosphere was the same as it had been all night, filled with love and happiness. She finished the song, and people started leaving the arena. I was sitting in the upper tier with my best friend, and we both left via the stairs leading down to the main corridor everybody uses to leave the arena. Thatâ€™s when the explosion occurred. It came from outside near the main foyer, I think. I heard the sound and immediately saw everybodyâ€™s reactions of fear and panic. It didnâ€™t seem real, and, initially, I had no idea how to react. I had no choice but to run with the hundreds of screaming parents, children and fans all heading toward the nearest exit. My head was filled with panic and terror, and my focus was on not losing my friend in the crowd. I was right behind him and made sure it stayed that way.

Once I got outside, I immediately rang my mum to let her know I was safe and ordered a taxi home as the Metrolink tram had stopped running by then.

The entire night had been so amazing, and Ariana preached so much positivity and happiness. What happened makes me sad, because concerts are supposed to be safe and a celebration of music. More than four hours later, I am still unable to sleep. I hope Ariana is staying strong, because nobody expected tonight to end the way it did, and she is such a kind and compassionate role model.

204806,321,tertiary,33,"â€œDespite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered,â€ Hicks told CNN on Saturday. On Sunday, Sen. Tim Kaine ( .) sharply criticized the White House for deploying a   tactic of Holocaust deniers. â€œThis is what Holocaust denial is,â€ Kaine said on NBC. â€œItâ€™s either to deny that it happened or many Holocaust deniers acknowledge, â€˜Oh yeah people were killed, but it was a lot of innocent people; Jews werenâ€™t targets.â€™â€‰â€ Conservative commentator John Podhoretz slammed the White Houseâ€™s defense of its actions in a column on Saturday, noting that Nazi ideology rested on the aim of exterminating Jewish people from the face of earth. â€œThe Nazis killed an astonishing number of people in monstrous ways and targeted certain groups  â€”   Gypsies, the mentally challenged, and open homosexuals, among others,â€ Podhoretz wrote. â€œBut the Final Solution was aimed solely at the Jews. The Holocaust was about the Jews"
204806,322,tertiary,12,"â€œThere is no â€˜proudâ€™ way to offer a remembrance of the Holocaust that does not reflect that simple, awful,   fact,â€ he added. â€œTo universalize it to â€˜all those who sufferedâ€™ is to scrub the Holocaust of its meaning. â€ In fact, the United Nations created the International Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2005 in part to combat a growing wave of   and Holocaust denial worldwide. In a speech on Friday in Washington, the Israeli ambassador to the United States warned against separating the history of the Holocaust from the Jewish people. â€œFor many, the Holocaust is primarily a universal story about manâ€™s inhumanity to man, about the evils of racism and xenophobia, about how even the most enlightened societies can descend into darkness and barbarism,â€ said Ambassador Ron Dermer. â€œBut if this noble universal vision is not firmly rooted in an appreciation that the Holocaust is first and foremost a Jewish story, it can become not only dangerous but even immoral. â€ The tactic of minimizing the impact of the Holocaust on Jewish people is also closely associated with nationalist movements in Europe, including the   National Front Party in France now led by Marine Le Pen, whose father,   Le Pen, was fined for Holocaust denial"
204806,323,primary,22,"The younger Le Pen has sought to make connections with Trump, calling his victory in the November election a â€œsign of hopeâ€ for her own political future. Countries such as Russia and Poland are also known to ignore the Jewish dimension of the Holocaust in public statements. But since International Holocaust Remembrance Day was created more than 10 years ago, former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, during their terms, referenced   or the slaughter of millions of Jewish people during World War II"
204806,324,tertiary,25,"â€œI donâ€™t understand why this is even a problem,â€ said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the   League. â€œThis is not a political issue, this is a matter of not just sensitivity, itâ€™s a matter of historical fact. â€œSix million Jews were slaughtered along with millions of other people,â€ he added. â€œBut the Holocaust was about this singular focus on the annihilation of the Jewish people. Thatâ€™s why we remember it. Thatâ€™s why there is a day, a sad day like this past Friday, to reflect upon it. â€ Kaine tied Trumpâ€™s move on Friday to bar the entry of travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries to the puzzling Holocaust statement issued on the same day"
204806,325,tertiary,25,"â€œThe fact that they did that and imposed this religious test against Muslims in the executive order on the same day, this is not a coincidence,â€ Kaine said. But Priebus noted that Trumpâ€™s    Jared Kushner, who is also a senior adviser in the White House, is Jewish. Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism before the two married"
204806,326,primary,50,"â€œYou know that President Trump has dear family members that are Jewish and there was no harm or ill will or offense intended by any of that,â€ Priebus added. It is not clear what role Kushner played in the crafting of the statement. During the campaign, Kushner defended Trump against accusations of   after Trump tweeted out a graphic featuring the Star of David overlaid on piles of money, an image that had been circulating in   circles online. â€œMy    is not an â€ Kushner wrote last year. And later in the campaign, Trumpâ€™s campaign released a â€œclosing argumentâ€ ad that juxtaposed images of Jewish financiers and public officials with a denunciation of a â€œglobal power structure. â€ The   League criticized the language in the ad for leaning on   tropes.

174254,331,primary,241,"The World Health Organization announced Friday that it no longer considers the Zika epidemic a public health emergency of international concern. But Zikaâ€™s threat to pregnant women and babies is not going away anytime soon, the agency says. Instead, the virus is now a chronic problem, says the WHOâ€™s Dr. Pete Salama. â€It is really important that we communicate this very clearly: We are not downgrading the importance of Zika,â€ Salama says. â€In fact, by placing this as a longer term program of work, weâ€™re sending the message that Zika is here to stay. And WHOâ€™s response is here to stay, in a robust manner.â€ One thing is clear: Zika is still spreading. And microcephaly cases are still growing. Argentina reported its first potential case this week. And Florida continues to find people who caught Zika inside the state. For these reasons, pregnant women  â€”   and their partners  â€”   still need to pay attention to where they travel, says Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. â€Regardless of how WHO defines Zika, [the disease] is unprecedented, and itâ€™s an extraordinary risk for pregnant women,â€ Frieden says. â€Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important that pregnant women not travel to places where Zika is spreading.â€ Right now, those places include countries across Latin America, the Caribbean, parts of Southeast Asia  â€”   and neighborhoods in Miami. WHO first declared Zika a public health emergency back in February. Back then, the situation looked dire. Brazil was investigating more than 4, 000 cases of microcephaly  â€”   a horrible birth defect where babies have brain damage and small heads. And health officials were predicting thousands of more cases, as Zika spread across the Western Hemisphere. â€If this pattern is confirmed beyond Latin America and the Caribbean, the world will face a severe public health crisis,â€ WHOâ€™s   Dr. Margaret Chan, said in February. But so far, that pattern hasnâ€™t repeated itself. Brazil has confirmed the most   microcephaly cases, about 2, 100. Other counties in Latin America have reported far fewer. Colombia has the second highest with 57 confirmed cases and the U. S. is third with 31, WHO said Thursday. Such a vast difference between the situation in Brazil versus other countries has raised some eyebrows. Could some other factor in Brazil be increasing the risk of microcephaly there? Perhaps a pesticide or another virus? â€I think itâ€™s too early to draw conclusions,â€ says Alessandro Vespignani, who models the spread of Zika virus at Northeastern University in Boston. Colombia is still investigating more than 300 microcephaly cases to see if theyâ€™re linked to Zika. Several countries, such as Venezuela and Haiti, have not been vigilant about reporting cases. And countries that are on top of reporting, such as Mexico and Puerto Rico, arenâ€™t expected to have microcephaly cases until next year  â€”   it takes around 9 months after a Zika outbreak strikes for the bulk of microcephaly cases to appear. â€We canâ€™t rule out the possibility that something unique is happening in Brazil,â€ Vespignani says. â€But, right now, we have to wait and see what happens elsewhere.â€"
170417,332,tertiary,322,"As the Supreme Courtâ€™s term comes to an end, here are some takeaways: The signal event in the   term was not a decision but a death. The court lost its   current member, Antonin Scalia, who died in February at age 79. Scalia had been appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and had long been the courtâ€™s intellectual anchor on the right. Scalia strove to read the Constitution as written and resisted efforts to expand its meaning or intent. His absence from a closely divided court led to a number of   ties, which allowed the last decision by lower courts to stand. Harder to quantify was the difference Scaliaâ€™s absence made to the other justicesâ€™ thinking and decision making. The loss of a   conservative majority turned some of the biggest cases of the year into dogs that didnâ€™t bark. Some conservative legal activists had anticipated several   victories in this term. They hoped to affirm restrictions on clinics providing abortions, knock out affirmative action in college admissions and permit states to count only eligible voters when apportioning their legislatures. They also saw a chance to free public employees such as teachers who oppose unionizing from the costs of collective bargaining. But with Scalia gone, the court could not muster the votes to accomplish any of these ends. Some of the cases may return to the court once all its seats are filled, but the missed opportunity and loss of Scalia were both keenly felt. Justice Anthony Kennedy continued to frustrate conservatives with his votes and opinions in high profile cases. Kennedy joined the court in 1988 as another Reagan appointee. But he has often been a swing vote, and in June he voted to strike down parts of an   law and also wrote the decision allowing the use of race as a factor in college admissions. Kennedy had also been a focal point at the end of the last court term, when he wrote the decision legalizing   marriage nationwide. Kennedy will soon be 80, but has given no evidence he is considering retirement. His pivotal positioning between left and right has made him the deciding vote so often that some call this â€the Kennedy Court.â€ President Obama lost what may have been his last big Supreme Court battle in office. The Democratic president has fared better in cases before the high court than might have been expected, largely because Chief Justice John Roberts has sided with the White House twice on major challenges to Obamacare. But Obamaâ€™s executive action deferring deportations for up to five million people in the country illegally was shelved when the Court deadlocked   on a challenge brought by Texas and other states. Obama had previously deferred deportation for millions of residents brought to the country illegally when they were children. That â€dreamersâ€ program is still in effect, but Obamaâ€™s attempt to broaden the protected category of family members was struck down in a federal district court in Texas in 2014. That judgeâ€™s ruling, since affirmed by a federal appeals court, froze the presidentâ€™s action and remains in effect. But the Court is expected to revisit the issue when it has a full complement of justices. It is not clear when the Scalia vacancy will be filled. To date, Senate Republicans have refused to consider Obamaâ€™s nomination of Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia. They say the next president should name Scaliaâ€™s successor, and the voters should have a chance to weigh in first. Unless the Senate relents  â€”   which it might after the election  â€”   the seat will remain vacant into the new year. A new president would be able to nominate someone after Inauguration Day (Jan. 20) but it would be weeks or months before the Senate held hearings or debated or voted. So the next court term could well be   throughout. That has led the justices to accept fewer cases and avoid putting major issues on the docket for  . The Courtâ€™s liberal bloc held, with the four Democratic appointees generally together on major issues. This was especially empowering on a   court, as four votes guaranteed no worse than a tie. In some cases, this protected lower court rulings or older precedents the liberal bloc supported (as in the case of public union dues). But even where the   tie left in place rulings the liberals would have preferred to overturn, it was not a   decision setting a new and   national precedent. There were liberal defections on some criminal cases, as when Justice Stephen Breyer sided with the majority to allow evidence from an unconstitutional arrest to be used against the arrestee, who was found to have an outstanding warrant. (Strieff). Several major cases were decided unanimously or with a single dissenting vote. Chief Justice John Roberts dislikes the image of a divided court, which tends to dilute the courtâ€™s authority. In this term, the justices were unanimous in vacating the conviction of former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell and in upholding the â€one person one voteâ€ principle and existing precedent in political apportionment (Evenwel). The court also agreed without dissent to kick the issue of contraception coverage under Obamacare back to lower courts (Zubik). Two other cases on the list below were decided with just one dissenting vote, cast by Justice Clarence Thomas in a   case and Justice Samuel Alito in a death penalty case. Here is a rundown on the 14 cases NPR paid the most attention to this year: 1. Abortion: Whole Womanâ€™s Health v. Hellerstedt, Vote:   Dissenters: Justices John Roberts (Chief) Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, In the most sweeping abortion decision in nearly 25 years, the Court struck down two provisions of a Texas abortion law, declaring them unconstitutional. The Texas law HB2  â€”   which State Sen. Wendy Davis famously filibustered in her pink tennis shoes  â€”   required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and it required the clinics to comply with several   standards. While the law was purportedly enacted to protect the health and safety of women, the Court majority, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, found to the contrary, arguing that the law â€provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an â€™undue burdenâ€™ on their constitutional right to do so.â€ When the Texas law came into effect, it cut the number of abortion facilities in half, from about 40 to about 20, requiring women to travel further distances to get an abortion. Reproductive rights advocates rejoiced in the result, whole   activists lamented and scratched their heads at Justice Kennedyâ€™s vote, cast with the Courtâ€™s liberal stalwarts. As for laws similar to HB2 in other states, if they include the same provisions nixed here, â€theyâ€™re dead.â€ 2. Affirmative Action: Fisher v. University of Texas  Vote:   Dissenters: Justices Samuel Alito, John Roberts (Chief) and Clarence Thomas, Recused: Justice Elena Kagan, The high court upheld affirmative action in college admissions in a landmark decision affirming that that race can be used as a factor to promote campus diversity. Writing for the Court, Justice Kennedy said that, â€Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission.â€ However, he noted, race is â€but a factor of a factor of a factor,â€ or just a piece of the admissions pie. Confounding court observers, this is the first time Justice Kennedy has voted to uphold a   program. This was Fisherâ€™s second trip to the Supreme Court. The litigation stretches back to 2008, when Abigail Fisher, a white prospective student, sued UT, claiming that the schoolâ€™s university program disadvantaged her. Her case was brought by Edward Blum, an activist and litigant known for challenging   policies. While they were disappointed by the Courtâ€™s decision, Blum and other opponents of   programs find a silver lining in cases pending in federal district courts. One accuses Harvard of using an illegal racial quota against   applicants, and a similar suit challenges the University of North   Hill for using racial preferences in the consideration of candidates. Both lawsuits are brought by Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. a nonprofit advocacy group representing students who are rejected from major colleges, headed by Blum. 3. Immigration: United States v. Texas, Vote:   The justices deadlocked on President Obamaâ€™s program to give temporary work permits to as many as five million undocumented immigrants whose children are American citizens, or are otherwise in the country legally. The    tie is effectively a â€â€ meaning that the lower court ruling that invalidated the program remains, at least for now. While this vote killed the Obama program, a future president may decide to revive it. The     decision comes as a big blow to immigrant rights advocates, as work authorizations will be revoked for millions, effective immediately. Opponents of the executive action applauded the opinion, believing that Obama overstepped the bounds of presidential power into lawmaking. Regardless, the issue will be    in the heated race for the White House. 4. Unions: Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, Vote:   In a victory for organized labor, a split Supreme Court effectively ruled that public employees who are not union members may be required to pay â€ â€ fees for the unionâ€™s collective bargaining activities. This upheld an earlier high court ruling of a generation ago allowing such fees"
170417,333,tertiary,327," activists brought the case in California  â€”   where 325, 000 teachers statewide are unionized across 1, 000 school districts  â€”   arguing that the fees impose an unconstitutional subsidy that violates their First Amendment rights of free speech and association. As NPR reported when the case was decided, only nine percent of the teachers in the 1, 000 districts have not joined the union, but because the law requires the union contract to cover them, they must pay to cover the cost of negotiating the basic contractual benefits they reap, such as wages and leave policies"
170417,334,tertiary,26," do not have to pay for union lobbying or political activities. Although Friedrichs in effect upheld an older precedent, the issue remains a political lightning rod, galvanizing both union proponents and opponents. And the   tie leaves the door open to a future challenge before a full   Court. 5. Contraception: Zubik v. Burwell, Vote:   In a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court announced that it would not rule on a challenge to contraception coverage under Obamacare, kicking the case back to the lower courts to strike a compromise. Sidestepping the constitutional question of whether Obamacareâ€™s contraceptive mandate substantially interfered with some the religious rights of some groups, the Court sent the government and   organizations back to hash out a plan that accommodated â€religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by their health plans received full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.â€ As NPR reported in May, the case concerned an accommodation offered to religious organizations, such as schools and hospitals, which object to providing their workers with insurance coverage for contraception. While the Affordable Care Act does not require religiously affiliated employers to provide contraceptives to their employees, it does mandate that they inform the government of their objection to the contraceptive coverage. That provider would then pay for the coverage. The   organizations challenging the government argued that providing the compulsory notice violated their religious beliefs, making them complicit in sinful conduct. In a rare move for the Court, the justiceâ€™s â€decision not to decideâ€ sought to mediate  â€”   rather than adjudicate  â€”   the dispute, proposing that the government may arrange to provide coverage to employees without requiring notice or action from the organizations. A resolution of this nature would likely require new federal regulations. 6. Voting Rights: Evenwel v. Abbott  Vote:   Concurrence: Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, voting with the majority, but for different reasoning, In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court held that states may draw their legislative districts based on total population, instead of the number of eligible voters. Writing for the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg upheld the â€one person, one voteâ€ bedrock principle of the American political system, citing constitutional history, the Courtâ€™s decisions and longstanding practice. The Court had long said that electoral districts must have roughly equal populations, but this is the first time that it affirmatively stated that this meant the same number of people, as opposed to eligible voters only. The ruling largely affirmed earlier precedent and the status quo. Counting all people in an electoral district boosts the political power of areas with large numbers of inhabitants who cannot legally vote, including   immigrants, undocumented immigrants and children. The decision came as a setback to conservative activists, who brought the challenge in Texas, and the Project on Fair Representation, the   group led by Edward Blum that successfully challenged a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. 7. Juvenile Justice: Montgomery v. Louisiana  Vote:   Dissenters: Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, The Supreme Court offered reprieve to as many as 2, 000 people serving mandatory prison terms of life without parole for homicides they committed as minors. This decision expands an earlier 2012 ruling, in which the justices banned lifelong sentences for juvenile murderers. In an uncommon move, the Court held that the 2012 ban must be applied retroactively, meaning that hundreds of inmates sentenced to automatic life terms for crimes they committed in their youth may have a chance for early release. The ruling encourages states not to find a new sentence to replace the ones struck down, but rather to consider granting parole, or release from behind bars, conditional on future behavior. 8. Capital Punishment:Hurst v. Florida, Vote:   Dissenter: Justice Samuel Alito, In an 8 to 1 vote, the U. S. Supreme Court in January struck down part of Floridaâ€™s capital punishment system, casting doubt on the status of the stateâ€™s nearly 400 people on death row. The Florida law allowed   juries in capital cases to recommend death sentences or life in prison without parole, but it left final sentencing to a judge, who is charged with finding facts and independently weighing both aggravating and mitigating factors before entering a sentence of life or death. Judges can and do disregard the juryâ€™s recommendation, called an â€advisory sentence.â€ As NPR reported in January, since Floridaâ€™s death penalty law was enacted in 1972, judges have ignored the juryâ€™s advisories some 300 times, imposing either the harsher penalty of death or the lesser penalty of life. Writing for the Court majority, Justice Sotomayor declared the stateâ€™s procedure unconstitutional, saying said that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial â€requires a jury and not a judge to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death.â€ â€A juryâ€™s mere recommendation is not enough,â€ she wrote. 9. Jury Selection: Foster v. Chatman, Vote:   Dissenter: Justice Clarence Thomas, The Court declared that Georgia prosecutors unconstitutionally and deliberately expelled blacks from the jury in a capital case, leaving an   panel to determine the destiny of a black defendant accused of killing a white woman. Evidence of racial discrimination came in the form of incriminating prosecutorâ€™s documents, including a jury list with each black prospective juror highlighted in green with â€Bâ€ printed next to it, alongside a legend showing that highlighting â€represents Blacks.â€ While this case was widely seen as an opportunity for the justices to call out blatant prosecutorial misconduct, the Court announced no clear rules, and proponents of criminal justice reform are not holding their breath. For now, former Justice Potter Stewartâ€™s famous definition of obscenity will be taken to apply to racial discrimination in jury selection: â€I know it when I see it.â€ 10. Police Stops: Utah v. Strieiff, Vote:   Dissenters: Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, The Supreme Court ruled in June that police who illegally stop a person on the street for no stated reason can check for an outstanding warrant, and if they find one, they can conduct a search and use evidence they find to prosecute. As NPR reported in June, the high court has long held that when law enforcement officials illegally stop or search someone without at least minimum reasonable suspicion, any incriminating evidence they find cannot be used in court. But there are exceptions to this rule, and in this case the Court carved out a new and big one, giving police far greater power to search people who were stopped without cause. The decision came in the case of Edward Strieff who was stopped after exiting a house that was under police watch, based on an anonymous tip that it was a site of drug activity. Though narcotics detective Douglas Fackrell later admitted he had no reason to believe Strieff had done anything wrong, he demanded Streiffâ€™s identification, and detained him while calling a police dispatcher to see if there were any outstanding warrants against Strieff. When the dispatcher told Fackrell about his traffic violation, the officer arrested and searched Streiff, finding methamphetamines. The Court reasoned that evidence seized from an unconstitutional stop was admissible, because there was a valid,   warrant for arrest, and because the discovery of the warrant weakened the connection between the stop and the evidence. In a   dissent, Justice Sotomayor said that the decision will allow police  â€”   as in this case  â€”   to stop someone on a mere â€whim or hunchâ€ and then leverage that stop to conduct a search, if the officer gets lucky and the person they stop has an outstanding warrant. She scoffed at the majorityâ€™s statement that there was nothing systematic about this stop. â€We must not pretend that the countless people who are routinely targeted by police are â€™isolated,â€™â€ she said, citing to state and federal databases, showing that there are more than 7. 8 million outstanding warrants, the vast majority of which are for minor violations. 11. Public Corruption: McDonnell v. United States, Vote:   In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court threw out the bribery convictions of Bob McDonnell, a former Republican governor of Virginia, contending that the government used an excessively overbroad definition of an â€official actâ€ of government in the corruption case it brought against him. McDonnell was convicted of leveraging the power of his political office to help Jonnie Williams, a businessman who showered the governor with loans, vacations and luxury products in excess of $175, 000. The gifts themselves were legal, and the question before the court was whether they were part of an unethical bargain in which McDonnell used his public position to help Williams. Despite calling McDonnellâ€™s acceptance of the gifts â€distasteful,â€ Chief Justice Roberts argued that arranging meetings, talking with other officials, or hosting events about Antabloc, Williamsâ€™   nutritional supplement, does not  â€”   without more  â€”   rise to the level of an â€official act,â€ because McDonnell took no action or decision in exchange for the gifts. â€Our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns,â€ he wrote for the Court. â€It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Governmentâ€™s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute. A more limited interpretation of the term â€™official actâ€™ leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption.â€ This decision is widely viewed as making it harder to convict politicians on corruption charges, and the verdict comes as good news for public officials, like New Jersey Sen. Robert Menenedez, a Democrat, who is awaiting an appeals court ruling in a corruption case"
170417,335,primary,250,"12. Political Speech: Heffernan v. City of Paterson, Vote:   Dissent: Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, In April, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that if an employer demotes an employee for his or her political activity, that employee can challenge the demotion on First Amendment grounds, even if the employerâ€™s actions are based on a factual mistake about the employeeâ€™s behavior. As NPR reported, the case was brought by Jeffrey Heffernan, a    veteran of the Paterson, N. J. police force, who was promoted to detective in 2005. Later, during the 2006 mayoral campaign, someone stole a yard sign from his motherâ€™s front lawn, and she asked Heffernan for a replacement. She supported the mayorâ€™s opponent. When he was   Heffernan went to pick up the sign for her at the challengerâ€™s campaign office, where he was spotted holding the sign and speaking with campaign staff. The police chiefâ€™s office caught wind of the incident, and assumed  â€”   incorrectly  â€”   that Heffernan was supporting the mayorâ€™s opponent. Upon returning home, he got a call that he was downgraded from his plum assignment in the police chiefâ€™s office to the walking squad. Writing for the   majority, Justice Breyer sided with Heffernan, holding that the central issue is the governmentâ€™s motive in demoting an employee for expressing political views that it may disagree with, so it doesnâ€™t matter whether the motive is based on facts or a mistake. â€The constitutional harm,â€ he concluded, â€is the same.â€  13. Judicial Ethics: Williams v. Pennsylvania, Vote:   Dissenters: Chief Justice John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, For the first time, the Supreme Court ruled that judges must recuse themselves from reviewing cases in which they had a prior significant role. By a vote of 5 to 3, the high court in June decided that a Pennsylvania judgeâ€™s personal involvement as a prosecutor in an earlier case presented an impermissible risk of actual bias, depriving the defendant of a fair hearing and denying the due process of law guaranteed by the constitution. The decision came in the case of Terrance Williams  â€”   a victim of beatings in his youth and sexual abuse from neighbors and older men  â€”   who was convicted in the brutal killing of a church deacon. The district attorney of Philadelphia at the time was Ronald Castille, who personally authorized seeking the death penalty in prosecuting Williams. Later, while campaigning for a seat on the state Supreme Court, Castille declared that he had secured 45 death sentences as DA, including that of Williams. As NPR reported in June, a state judge held an evidentiary hearing of the case and set aside the death sentence on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, concluding that the DAâ€™s office hid mitigating evidence that the deacon had sexually molested Williams. The state appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, where Castille was serving as chief justice. Despite a motion from the defense to disqualify himself, Castille refused to step off the case. The court reinstated Williamsâ€™s death penalty by a unanimous vote. In June, the Supreme Court threw out that decision, giving Williams a shot at a new trial. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, announced that â€an unconstitutional potential for bias exists when the same person serves as both accuser and adjudicator.â€ Castille, he concluded, could not be a neutral arbiter as both Williamsâ€™s prosecutor and his judge. 14. Guns: Voisine v. United States, Vote:   Dissenters: Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor, The Court ruled that reckless domestic assaults constitute a â€misdemeanor crime of domestic violenceâ€ that trigger restrictions on gun ownership. Per examples provided by Justice Elena Kagan, if someone engages in risky behavior  â€”   such as throwing a plate at a wall near a spouse, or slamming a door in the face of girlfriend or boyfriend close behind  â€”   that person is subject to the federal ban on firearms possession. Womenâ€™s rights, domestic violence, and gun control advocacy groups hailed the verdict as a victory, while opponents regarded the ruling as an unjustified, even unconstitutional, limitation on the Second Amendment right to bear arms."
213153,336,secondary,392,"     Thereâ€™s great news for women who dread that annual pelvic exam (i. e. basically everyone). On Tuesday, a panel made up of medical experts that advise the government said that thereâ€™s not enough evidence to support doing them for women who are healthy and not pregnant. The conclusion, issued as a draft recommendation by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, is a strong endorsement of the recent evidence that has been building against the practice that is performed 63 million times annually and is estimated to cost $2. 6 billion. This is the first time the task force has made a statement related to pelvic exams for gynecologic conditions and is likely to impact what millions of women decide to do about the test and what insurers will cover. â€œThe Task Force is calling for more research to better understand the benefits and harms of performing screening pelvic exams in women without any complaints or symptoms,â€ Task Force member Francisco GarcÃ­a said in a statement. In 2014, the American College of Physicians, which is made up of internists, expressed similar reservations about the procedure. The group said that in reviewing 60 years of research they did not find support for the idea that it helps catch cancer or other conditions in women who do not have symptoms such as bleeding or pain. One particularly telling study found that doctors said they do pelvic exams is to â€œensure adequate compensationâ€ and because patients expect it. However, the ACP said the test does cause harm because of the invasive nature of the procedure and because it sends many women down a rabbit hole of tests and surgeries when their condition is actually benign. The ACPâ€™s statement has put it at odds with another medical group    the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists which has said the test builds trust and that the decision about whether to screen or not screen is an individual one that should be left up to doctors and their patients"

The USPSTF will review the feedback and issue its final recommendation. The federal government is not required to follow what the panel says but usually does, which would impact coverage through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid and Medicare through the states and have a trickle down effect to private insurers. Right now a pelvic exam is usually covered as part of a yearly well visit. So that means that in the near future you could still get that pelvic exam if you feel you need it, but you may have to pay the entire expense out of pocket. This post has been updated.

217540,340,secondary,116,"     Donald Trump is a fascist. When you call somebody a fascist, you can mean any number of things. Often, it means no more than â€œsomebody I donâ€™t like. â€ It is an   epithet, usable by anyone against everyone from university deans to Fox News anchors. For that reason, the label should be used sparingly  â€”   saved for special occasions. As with â€œNaziâ€ or â€œHitler,â€ it is often said that in any discussion, the first person reduced to using such a word has lost the argument. Itâ€™s ridiculous to compare any living person to Hitler or Mussolini"
217540,341,primary,14,"But I mean â€œfascistâ€ in the more clinical sense. For close to a year, and especially since his election as president, people have been trying to figure out Trumpâ€™s political principles: What does he stand for, how will he act as president? Various theories have been advanced. Some think he won the election by pandering simultaneously to different groups with conflicting agendas, and convincing all of them he was on their side. Was this a calculated exploitation of Americaâ€™s â€œgimme gimme gimmeâ€ politics? Or was it the politics of a man who had no politics, who wanted to be president because, in our celebrity culture, it was the only job more glamorous than starring in his own reality television show? It has even been suggested, in the sole subject of conversation in Washington for the past month, that Trump might allow himself to be sworn in as president and then resign, having accomplished all he aspired to. But now that weâ€™ve seen a bit of him in action, it seems that Trump actually does have a recognizable agenda that explains how he simultaneously can pander to big business generally while â€œ â€ (the words of a Post editorial Friday) an air conditioning manufacturer to save a few hundred jobs for a while. Or how he can make nice with the authoritarian Vladimir Putin while making bellicose foreign policy noises in general. Or how he can blithely upset with a phone call the absurdly delicate balance of our relations with China and Taiwan. All this seemingly erratic behavior can be explained  â€”   if not justified  â€”   by thinking of Trump as a fascist. Not in the sense of an   bad guy, but in the sense of somebody who sincerely believes that the toxic combination of strong government and strong corporations should run the nation and the world. He spent his previous career negotiating with the government on behalf of corporations; now he has switched teams. But itâ€™s the same game. The game has several names: â€œCorporate statismâ€ is one. In Europe, they call it â€œdirigisme. â€ Those two other words for it  â€”   â€œNazismâ€ and â€œfascismâ€  â€”   are now beyond all respectability. It means, roughly, combining the power of the state with the power of corporations. At its mildest, it is intrusive regulations on business about parental leave and such. At its most toxic, it is concentration camps. In the 1930s, a few Americans (including a few liberals) bought into it. Pearl Harbor ended that argument. Even for Trump, â€œfascismâ€ itself now is a dirty word, not just a policy choice. Even Trump would not use it  â€”   least of all about himself. But the deal Trump negotiated with Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies, to â€œsaveâ€ hundreds of jobs is a prime example of the philosophy. Trump brags about â€œsavingâ€ Midwestern   jobs through a combination of bribery and  . Turns out hundreds more jobs will be lost, and Trump as president canâ€™t possibly negotiate on behalf of millions of workers. But Trump believes  â€”   truly believes, I think  â€”   in the title of one of his books: the art of the deal. He thinks he is the worldâ€™s greatest negotiator. When he says he wonâ€™t reveal his income taxes because he is in the midst of negotiations with the IRS, he may be sincere. He says, believably, that he gets audited every year. That means every yearâ€™s tax bill is just the governmentâ€™s opening move in an annual chess game, and Trump doesnâ€™t want to give away his own opening move. Now he plans to negotiate more â€œdealsâ€ and he thinks  â€”   because he can outfox some midlevel IRS auditors  â€”   that he can outfox the political and business leaders of the world. â€œThe Art of the Dealâ€ is not â€œMein Kampf,â€ although â€œnot â€˜Mein Kampfâ€™ â€ isnâ€™t much of an endorsement. Just to be clear: If Iâ€™m correct that Trump actually has a governing philosophy, thatâ€™s a bad thing, not a good thing. If he actually has principles to guide him through those famous swamps he plans to drain, thatâ€™s alarming, not reassuring. Bad principles are not a good substitute for no principles. Four or eight years of bad principles may make no principles look pretty good"

206424,344,secondary,170,"       TAWILA, Syria  â€”   Late last year, two American Marxists traveled to northeastern Syria with the goal of experiencing firsthand the egalitarian utopia Syriaâ€™s Kurds are seeking to build"
206424,345,secondary,455,"Instead, they found themselves fighting on the front lines of a war, against the Islamic State and alongside the agents of imperialism that their political convictions have taught them to despise. For Brace Belden, 27, a florist from San Francisco, and Lucas Chapman, 21, an American University history graduate, a journey intended to deepen their understanding of how socialism works turned into much more of an adventure than they had anticipated. They fired guns, got shot at, and as they prepared to head home, have learned from news reports that a movie is going to be made based on a Rolling Stone article that described their experiences, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Belden and Chapman are among hundreds of Westerners who have made the journey to northeastern Syria over the past two years to volunteer with the Kurds, which is not illegal in the United States. Many of them are U. S. veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who want to get into the fight. Some, however, like Belden and Chapman, are idealists, intrigued by the new society the Syrian Kurds claim to be building. The two men say they had intended to immerse themselves in the community structures being established by the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Union, the   political party that controls northeastern Syria"

Then they were given uniforms, assigned to the heavy weapons unit of the partyâ€™s military wing  â€”   known as the YPG, or Peopleâ€™s Protection Units  â€”   and dispatched to the front line outside Raqqa, the Islamic Stateâ€™s   capital. There they became part of the ongoing, U. S"
206424,347,tertiary,554,"offensive aimed at encircling the city that is expected soon to lead to a final assault on the Islamic Stateâ€™s most symbolically important possession. It wasnâ€™t always as exciting as it sounds. When we met them in late November at an abandoned farmhouse in a pinprick of a village north of Raqqa, they were sipping tea in the bright winter sun, smoking cigarettes and waiting for something to happen. A chicken slurped on the remnants of their previous round of tea, discarded on a tray nearby. A couple of mortars exploded, too far away to be of concern. â€œItâ€™s fairly boring,â€ said Chapman, who had been living in Washington until he graduated from American last summer. â€œItâ€™s really boring,â€ said Belden, who sold potted plants and flowers in San Francisco before deciding he wanted to witness the practice of his Marxist beliefs. â€œItâ€™s true what they say about war  â€”   that itâ€™s 10 percent action and 90 percent waiting for something to happen. â€    Lucas Chapman, a U. S. volunteer with the YPG, sits in a rear base near Tal Samin, Syria. (Alice   The Washington Post)  At least in the early stages of the Raqqa operation, now in its fifth month, the Islamic State put up little resistance, choosing instead to plant booby traps and fire mortars to slow the advance of their enemies, but avoiding direct confrontation. As novices to war, both men seemed relieved that this was the case. Though they had not met before showing up together at the training course last October, they had since bonded over their shared lack of experience in all things military, and their befuddlement at finding themselves riding into battle equipped with weapons they barely knew how to use. Their unit possessed some   guns known as â€œDushkas,â€ a makeshift armored vehicle and some light artillery, which it wasnâ€™t their job to fire. â€œAnyone can learn it, if they want to. A life of floristry has definitely prepared me for this,â€ Belden said, meaning the opposite. They had, however, fired the   automatic weapons that were issued to them. â€œIf ISIS are being shot at by a weedy guy like me, they must be losing,â€ said Belden, who doesnâ€™t think he killed anyone but canâ€™t be sure. Chapman said he had nearly opened fire on an ISIS fighter, a man with a big beard who looked suspicious from a distance of about 800 yards, but his commander ordered him not to, so he didnâ€™t"
206424,348,secondary,2,"[U. S. military aid is fueling big ambitions for Syriaâ€™s leftist Kurdish militia]   The growing U. S. military presence in northeastern Syria is one of the reasons Belden and Chapman have decided to head home soon, despite intentions expressed earlier this year to stay for the final Raqqa offensive. The YPG has forged a close military alliance with the United States, which has about 1, 000 troops serving alongside Kurdish and Arab forces and is expected to send 1, 000 more. Though they rarely encountered the U. S. forces, the American presence was disconcerting for committed Marxists dedicated to the overthrow of the Western capitalist system. â€œAs a Marxist, I have to get used to contradictions. Itâ€™s more a case of two interests aligning temporarily,â€ said Belden, who does not believe the alliance will last. But, he said, he wouldnâ€™t fight alongside U. S. ground troops. â€œI do oppose all American presence in Syria. The U. S. Army and Marines represent something totally reprehensible to me. â€ Chapman fears the United States will eventually abandon the Kurds and their socialist experiment after using them to conquer Raqqa. â€œTheyâ€™ve betrayed the Kurds before, and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they do it again,â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™re occupiers and imperialists. â€    Two members of the Womenâ€™s Protection Units, or YPJ, stand in a house used as a rear base in Tawila, Syria, in November. (Alice   The Washington Post)  Other aspects of their experience jolted the assumptions they had come with. They were perturbed by the relish with which the YPG greeted the U. S. presidential election of Donald Trump, who is being hailed within the secularist group as an enemy of Muslims. Chapman is an observant Jew, and one of his hopes was to find a way to bridge the gulf between Muslims and Jews by demonstrating his solidarity with Islam. Instead, he found himself fighting alongside people who denounced Muslims. â€œThereâ€™s a lot about it thatâ€™s not utopia,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s disappointing when people say things like â€˜All Muslims must leave.â€™â€‰â€ After their spell on the front lines together, he and Belden parted ways. Chapman joined a medical unit, which he said he found more rewarding than fighting. Belden teamed up with a different militia, called the United Freedom Forces, or BOG, founded by Marxist Leninist Kurds from Turkey. With them, he said, he found some of the socialist kinship he had been seeking, as well as more action on the battlefield. They have now reunited for the journey home. Chapman, who has learned to speak Kurdish, hopes to work with Kurdish organizations in the United States. Belden wants to marry his girlfriend and return to Syria with her  â€”   to join a   political organization, not to fight. He also has another wish  â€”   to halt production of the planned movie, which is based on an article in Rolling Stone called â€œThe Anarchists vs. the Islamic State. â€ The proposal for the film, to be directed by Daniel Espinosa and starring Gyllenhaal, was recently announced by the Hollywood Reporter. Belden, who says he is not an anarchist, was as surprised as all of his friends when he found out about it. â€œIâ€™ve got to stop this movie. Itâ€™ll probably be exploitative and orientalist. It will taint everything I do,â€ he said in a message as he prepared to leave Syria this week. â€œIâ€™m a communist. I donâ€™t want fame. â€   Correction: An earlier version of this article said Lucas Chapman was a graduate of Georgetown University. He is a graduate of American University"

203460,352,tertiary,157,1) Meth was not my problem. It was my attempt at a solution to my problems. My problem was me; I was my problem
203460,353,secondary,120,"I never got high on meth in order to become a    version of myself. I got high on meth because I wanted to morph into a completely different person. This desire to be someone different started young. As a kid, Iâ€™d bring home stacks of books from the library   â€¦     any fantasy world was worth escaping toward. I was too uncoordinated to compete in sports, too sensitive not to start bawling when the teachers yelled. Where I went to school: reading, crying, and being uncoordinated? Not exactly a campaign platform upon which one might run for class president. I was afraid to stand up to the schoolyard bullies. What few attempts there were to start conversations with girls in study hall ended about as well as you might imagine"
203460,354,tertiary,388,"  I grew up learning not to like myself very much. Throughout most of my adult life, I had compulsions. Compulsive smoking, compulsive eating, compulsive  . As if by doing enough of something, the doer  â€”   me  â€”   would become someone new. Drugs were the compulsion that seemed to present a path to getting there quickest"
203460,355,tertiary,167,"   There were plenty of drugs available to a college student in San Francisco. One clear blue morning, a friend stopped by with a baggie of crystalline shards. He cut up tiny lines; I snorted one, and pain exploded in my head. As the pain subsided, the psychic gears began to shift. The high was the kind that brought with it feelings that not only was   possible, it was also acceptable  â€”   that little line I snorted turned me into someone worthwhile. Other drugs might have gotten me high, but here was a medicament that made me feel like a whole new person. 2) The traditional markers of a good life (money, job, status, relationships) failed to solve my problems. Therefore, it was not so difficult to let go of those things in favor of meth. For the next   years, drugs were not the only priority, but they were always number one. I took the college classes that were the easiest path to a degree, held down jobs that werenâ€™t so challenging they couldnâ€™t be performed at an acceptable level while high or hung over, found as a soul mate a woman who loved to get wasted with me. I got a home, a car, and a motorcycle. Money came easy, mostly due to my privileged socioeconomic status"
203460,356,tertiary,63,"  Then meth became the drug of choice. The first thing to go away was the intimacy with a soul mate; romantic relationships become superficial and centered on shared base desires. I started using meth every weekend. Then I started using it weekdays after work. Then I used it before work, then during work, then instead of work. There were two groups of people in my life: those from whom Iâ€™d conceal my use, and those from whom Iâ€™d conceal how much I was using"
203460,357,tertiary,185,"After about six years of regular and increasing meth use, my life was a seesaw: on one side, the home, relationships and the rest. On the other side, the meth and its promise to make me a new person. Meth outweighed it all. It launched everything else off that seesaw and far into the distance. It wasnâ€™t the methâ€™s fault. I was always deeply unsatisfied with money, relationships, and status; meth might, in fact, have saved me from finding a more permanent solution to the problem of being me. When 2004 began, I found myself without a job, romantic relationship, or associations with anyone outside my circle of   friends. Iâ€™d sold my home and begun to spend vast amounts of time and money on electronics that I tore apart looking for hidden cameras and microphones, guitars that I smashed to bits, driven to fits of rage and loneliness by the disembodied voices that had become my sole and constant companions. I went to strip clubs where it was clear the entertainers were only acting like friends because I paid them. Which was okay. They were always such good actors"
203460,358,primary,351,"   I became a   denizen of the world of methamphetamine psychosis. Mornings meant coming to with the cold steel barrel of a shotgun resting on my chest  â€”   it was how Iâ€™d passed out the night before, waiting to blast away at the gangsters who were coming to kick down the door and kidnap and torture me to death"
203460,359,secondary,107,"The disembodied voices of family and former friends pled for rescue   â€¦     theyâ€™d been taken hostage by futuristic criminals with the technology to put voices in my head. The criminals were going to kill the people I once loved and set me up to take the blame. Or Iâ€™d become caught up in an operation conducted by the CIA, because folks Iâ€™d known and trusted were actually spies and I had been recruited as an agent to expose their treason and send them to prison, to the electric chair. 3) While my life as an addict was rife with horror and fear, it also had moments of sublime beauty One disembodied voice wove its way through the years of psychosis. She called herself my Promised One. The Promised One sang out late at night. Iâ€™d gallantly push aside the danger posed by the unseen enemies and take a cab through the shimmering city, gliding on a nighttime highway, headed toward the luminescent downtown and guided only by the sound of her voice and a belief that there was love, hope, and a finer life at that voiceâ€™s source. Sometimes I believed the hallucinations were the work of a race of space aliens that had selected me as an ambassador and were toughening me up for the journey to come. These beings wouldnâ€™t have been aliens on whatever planet they were from. They had traveled a vast distance to find and take me away to somewhere better, and theirs was a world into which even someone like me might someday fit. Thanks to the hallucinations and delusions, the kid who never stood up to bullies or gathered the courage to talk to girls now battled powerful enemies and risked everything to be with his Promised One. Iâ€™d become a hero in the world of the psychosis. 4) The unacceptable  â€”   jails, psych wards, homeless shelters  â€”   became normal In his book Permanent Midnight, Jerry Stahl writes about his heroin addiction: With drugs, the unthinkable becomes routine, and the routine is something you never have to think about, because of the drugs"

Now there was enough money for about a dayâ€™s worth of meth. The next afternoon, I went to the same relativeâ€™s home to try the same thing. When the police came, I demanded to speak to an FBI agent because I had been secretly recruited via subliminal messaging to act as a clandestine agent at the heart of a sweeping   operation. I spent the next 24 hours in a safety cell, naked, surrounded by padded walls and with a straitjacket for a blanket. From there came transfer to a psych ward and eventually to county jail"
203460,361,primary,90,"In a   period, I had at least 16    interactions with law enforcement. Weâ€™re not talking traffic tickets here. Sometimes others called the authorities on me.

The police came to my home five times. I was put in handcuffs four times and arrested three. These types of experiences were as routine as business trips. Something one had to engage in, if not enjoy; a necessary evil within oneâ€™s chosen profession"
203460,362,primary,87,"5) Quitting meth meant facing up to my false belief that by quitting meth, my problems would go away In early 2006, feeling the pressure, I decided to take a stab at getting clean for a little while. I entered rehab and got hired by Stanford University to work as a research professional in the brand new,     cancer center. I left rehab, rented an apartment just off the Stanford campus. One Saturday, two months later, I caught the train up to San Francisco and knocked on the door of the motel room where my old meth dealer was staying. We went to the strip clubs and partied all night. Four months later, a regular meth head once again, I was staying in a homeless shelter"
203460,363,secondary,68,"The homeless shelter had an outdoor smoking area. One enterprising young man sold cigarettes for a quarter each. I jingled the 50 cents in my pocket. Later, as I was smoking, the thought came: I had just spent   of my entire net worth on a single cigarette. Another thought came: â€œItâ€™s time for things to be okay again. Now all I need to do is stop doing meth. â€ Deep down was the knowledge that it wasnâ€™t true, that quitting meth would, for a time, actually make things worse. There would be nothing left to tamp down those feelings, no more seeming path to becoming a new person"
203460,364,secondary,380,"I spent the next year bouncing back and forth between rehabs, soup kitchens, attempts to reconcile with family, and long stretches sunk deep in methamphetamine psychosis"
203460,365,secondary,98,"   With the decision to put away the pipe for good came feelings of transparency, nakedness. As if my thoughts, feelings, and history were right there for anyone to see. The one way for me to try and come to terms with it was embracing spirituality. To paraphrase George Harrison: Everything can wait except the search for spiritual meaning. Although Iâ€™ve been exploring spirituality for nine years, I remain very much a beginner. My goal is to not stop improving at making compassion, gratitude, and respect for others the key driving forces in my life. The best way Iâ€™ve come up with to describe my journey involves asking the listener to imagine a mountain and not worry too much about what name to give its summit, whether that name is heaven, spiritual awakening, or something else. Many paths lead to the mountaintop. Some paths are gentle and sunlit, and traveled by many. Some are narrow, solitary, and obscure. The various routes intersect and diverge. But they all lead to the same place"
203460,366,secondary,152,"This is the patchwork spirituality I have practiced and continue to practice. Alone and with others, struggling and moving with ease, confident and unsure. I am Jewish by birth, Christian by baptism. My daily meditation practice borders on Buddhism. Who knows, maybe thereâ€™s some aspects of Hinduism mixed in by way of my having adopted, in a fashion halting yet improving through the years, what I understand from reading the  :   devotion to the concept of a guiding force. I hope to someday discover where a connection to Muslim faith might fit in. It may seem that Iâ€™m confused; indeed, this is so, and hopefully it will stay that way. When it comes to spiritual matters, when the day comes that Iâ€™m no longer confused  â€”   when Iâ€™m sure that thereâ€™s only one right way to get to that mountaintop  â€”   that will be the day I know Iâ€™m wrong. That Iâ€™ve stopped allowing the universe to be my guide. For now Iâ€™ll continue exploring different paths, free from being bound by any belief thereâ€™s just one right way to get where Iâ€™m going. If there is such a thing as God, Iâ€™m confident sheâ€™s of the nature so as to be shepherding me along those routes that are right. 6) Friends and family, though   could no more help me with my addiction than they could help with a heart condition by attempting to perform cardiac surgery upon me Spirituality worked for me, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean it is the right solution for all addicts. What I do know is that the loved ones and friends who offered their help couldnâ€™t have known what they were up against. In the old days, one was not considered foolish for believing Earth to be flat and at the center of a swirling solar system. It stood to sound reasoning that were I to give up meth, the matter would be resolved. The family and friends werenâ€™t wrong to believe that. Even I believed it, at least on the surface. That day in the homeless shelter, I finally admitted that I needed help. But family and friends  â€”   who should have been obvious places to which to turn  â€”   were, through no real fault of their own, not viable sources"
203460,367,secondary,400,"  If you treated me in a way I felt was unfair, I resented you. But if you treated me well, that resentment was even greater   â€¦     because I knew the real me and assumed that, somehow, you did, too. Why would you want to assist a person like me? In my   mind, the answer had to be that you were pretending to care about me, and in that case must be out to get me. The only help I was able to receive came from people who themselves were once like me. My addiction was in part a symptom of loneliness and isolation, before my pursuit of spirituality led to the realization that Iâ€™m never truly alone. My fellow addicts were the first (and, sometimes still the only) general group of humans with whom I felt able to form a connection. Maybe Iâ€™m like the clichÃ©d   from the movies, who canâ€™t seem to make sense of life outside the war zone without those spoken and unspoken bonds with battle mates. The biggest part of me, the piece that is who I really am, is firmly rooted in my ability (or lack thereof) to translate those truths revealed by addiction  â€”   which always seemed like weaknesses  â€”   into sources of strength"
203460,368,primary,2,"Perhaps itâ€™s the case with someone you love. For what it may be worth: Try to accept that for many of us addicts, the best help  â€”   the only real help  â€”   canâ€™t come directly from you. This can be a formidable task, this acceptance.

163209,370,tertiary,134,"Duncan Hines, traveling salesman and future purveyor of boxed cake mix, considered himself an authority on a great many things: hot coffee, Kentucky   ham and how to locate a tasty restaurant meal, in 1935, for under a dollar and a quarter. By the 1950s, Hinesâ€™ name would be plastered on boxes of cake mix housewives would turn to his products for consistent quality and superior taste. Newspaper photographs featured Hines clad in a white chefâ€™s apron, hoisting a neatly frosted cake or thoughtfully dipping a spoon into a mixing bowl. But Duncan Hines wasnâ€™t a chef  â€”   in truth, he could barely cook. For most of his career, he had just been a businessman, desperate for a decent meal on the road. Through his search for the best restaurants across America, he became an accidental gourmand, an unlikely author and homegrown connoisseur. Although boxed cake mix is the legacy that most people now associate with Duncan Hines (only after asking, â€Was he actually a real person? â€) the supermarket foods that bear his name are only an epilogue to a storied life traveling Americaâ€™s back roads. It was really his book, Adventures in Good Eating, that first put Duncan Hines on the map. And it was his tireless pursuit of good food that inspired his book. A decent meal, Hinesâ€™ appreciation for a good meal arose out of mere necessity. From the 1920s through the â€™40s, he motored across the country hawking letter openers and paperclips and subsisting on unreliable road food. It was an era long before any formal restaurant rating system existed in the U. S. The names and locations of good restaurants were conveyed by word of mouth for an    traveler, locating a decent supper was often a daunting and discouraging mission. And although Europe had relied on The Michelin Guide since 1900, middle America in the 1920s and â€™30s was still a land of culinary mystery and inconsistency. It was also a time of growing wanderlust. Highways such as Route 66 were connecting small towns, and eager motorists often embarked on weekend road trips. According to the University of Michigan, in the â€™20s â€the number of automobiles in America rose from eight million to   million and along with the increase came thousands of barbeque shacks, ice cream stands and diners.â€ Many new restaurants were not listed on maps. And they were often hidden on dusty back roads that health inspectors didnâ€™t travel. (Even if they did, there was no standard for restaurant food safety in America at that time.) Desperate for a clean place to dine, Hines became an investigative epicurean and   restaurant critic. He carried a tiny journal in his coat pocket, jotting down the precise locations of his favorite places. No restaurant was off limits for the inquisitive Hines. â€The kitchen is the first spot I inspect in an eating place,â€ he wrote. â€More people will die from hit or miss eating than from hit and run driving,â€ he joked  â€”   though Hines clearly thought food safety was no laughing matter. He frequently popped into the kitchen to scrutinize how staff handled food and then swung around back to investigate the restaurantâ€™s garbage pile. He meticulously recorded the names of the most pristine diners, the inns with the tastiest prime roast beef, and where to find the stickiest honey buns. He appreciated regional cuisine, quickly discovering in which part of the country to brake for broiled lobster tail (New England) and where to stop for fried chicken (Kentucky). Hines noted whether a restaurant had air conditioning, its hours of operation and its prices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. â€His restaurant notes were extraordinarily accurate,â€ says Louis Hatchett, author of the book, Duncan Hines: How a Traveling Salesman Became the Most Trusted Name in Food. â€As word spread among his family and friends, people were begging him to share the list he had created. There was nothing out there like it,â€ he says. â€In 1935, sick of being pestered, he finally sent out a little blue pamphlet in his Christmas cards, containing a list of 167 restaurants across 33 states that he could safely recommend.â€ Soon, Hines was receiving postcards from from salesmen, newlyweds and other travelers all over America seeking his recommendations for good, clean restaurants. In 1936, at 55, Hines   his first edition of Adventures in Good Eating and sold them for $1 each. It contained the names and locations of 475 restaurants from coast to coast that had Hinesâ€™ rigorous seal of approval. â€The books were sold through word of mouth, but they quickly sold out. The following year he raised the guideâ€™s price to $1. 50  â€”   and thatâ€™s where the price would stay for the next 25 years,â€ explains Hatchett. Each year, until he retired in 1954, Hines broadened his exploration of Americaâ€™s restaurants and published an updated edition of Adventures in Good Eating. Restaurants fell in and out of Hinesâ€™ favor  â€”   if they could not deliver a quality meal or allow a peek into the kitchen, they were removed from the book. He refused to accept any advertisements or endorsements from restaurants in exchange for reviews. Millions of discerning travelers kept his book in their glove compartments to guide them as they rumbled down gravelly country roads in unfamiliar locations. â€Recommended by Duncan Hinesâ€ became the gold standard in dining by the 1950s. Restaurants endorsed by Hines tacked up metal signs in their front windows. As his authority grew, Hines published Lodging for a Night (1938) and Adventures in Good Cooking (Famous Recipes) and the Art of Carving in the Home (1939). In 1952, when Hines was 72, he partnered with Roy H. Park to form   in Ithaca, N. Y. allowing the Duncan Hines name to appear on everything from cartons of ice cream to the   cake mixes. Two years before his death in March of 1959, the entire franchise was sold to Procter  Gamble. Renewed interest, Thanks to Ebay and rare book vendors, there is resurging interest in Adventures in Good Cooking. History lovers and discriminating foodies congregate on the forums of Roadfood. com to share modern forays into Hinesâ€™ antiquated restaurant scene. Jim Pfefferle, a forum member and engineer from Wisconsin, views Duncan Hinesâ€™ swift rise to fame as compelling as the material in his books. â€Itâ€™s kind of meteoric, what Duncan Hines did,â€ Pfefferle tells NPR. â€He was unknown when he published his first guidebook in 1936 and then there was a World War. By 1951 he was famous, the one person in the United States that anyone would go to for an authority on food. Less than 10 years later, he was gone.â€ Pfefferle, along with other members of the forum, has spent the past two years painstakingly gathering a list of restaurants from Hinesâ€™ books that are still in operation. He says it has been an intimidating task filled with many gastronomic   but he believes that about 37 of the original 167 restaurants on Hinesâ€™ 1935 list remain. Hines often said, â€Nearly everyone wants at least one outstanding meal a day.â€ This seems as true now as it did a   ago. But long before Yelp or TripAdvisor offered restaurant reviews with the click of a button, Hines was doing it his own way, by traveling the highway with his pencil and notebook, changing the way America ate on the open road  â€”   one adventure at a time.

171693,371,secondary,694,"We should have been prepared for the Ryan Lochte drama in Rio. Weâ€™ve seen this reality show before. Or at least we could have, if we were paying very close attention to the E! television channel back in 2013. After Lochteâ€™s strong showing at the London Olympics in 2012, which included five medals, the swimmer and E! teamed up for a reality show called What Would Ryan Do? It offered an intimate look at his   process under the influence of tequila shots, bright lights and lots of young women, all while not wearing a shirt. Lochte, that is, not the women. The simple premise was to shadow Lochte, his   persona and his love of partying, for eight    episodes. It wasnâ€™t memorable, but it did give us his signature phrase, â€Jeah!â€ Unfortunately, E! didnâ€™t stick with it through the Rio Games. Ryan â€is an incredibly endearing personality who is sexy, entertaining and fun,â€ E! President Suzanne Kolb said before it launched. â€Watching this show, I believe people will fall into three categories: They want to be him, sleep with him or mother him.â€ It may not be fair to drag Lochteâ€™s mother into this, but she unwittingly played a key role in the circus playing out in Rio. On Sunday morning, Ileana Lochte was the first to tell the media her son had been robbed. â€I think theyâ€™re all shaken up. There were a few of them,â€ she told USA Today, adding that she learned this in a text from her son. â€They were just, they just took their wallets and basically that was it.â€ On Thursday, two of Lochteâ€™s teammates who were with him that night confirmed that the foursome actually vandalized a gas station bathroom, were asked to pay for it, and got testy. They also confirmed that they fabricated the robbery story. Lots of teenagers donâ€™t give their moms the straight story about what happened on a Saturday night. But Lochte is 32, and once his mom spoke out, there was no turning back. U. S. Olympic officials initially denied he was robbed. But a couple of hours later, Lochte gave an interview to NBC: â€We got pulled over, in the taxi, and these guys came out with a badge, a police badge, no lights, no nothing, just a police badge, and they pulled us over. . .. They pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground  â€”   they got down on the ground. I refused, I was like, we didnâ€™t do anything wrong, so  â€”   Iâ€™m not getting down on the ground. â€And then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, â€™Get down,â€™ and I put my hands up, I was like â€™whatever.â€™ He took our money, he took my wallet  â€”   he left my cellphone, he left my credentials.â€ Since then, the story has had more flips and turns than Lochteâ€™s races in the pool. Hereâ€™s the video of Lochte and his three teammates at the gas station where the episode took place in the early hours of Sunday. You can see our full story here. In short, Lochteâ€™s initial account of an armed robbery, with a cocked gun to his head, was actually a dispute at the gas station over access to the bathroom. The United States Olympic Committee issued a statement Thursday night apologizing for â€an act of vandalismâ€ by one of the Americans, who was not named. â€The behavior of these athletes is not acceptable,â€ the statement added. But hereâ€™s the larger story: Lochte has badly tarnished one of the great Olympic careers of all time. Over four Olympiads, heâ€™s won 12 medals, six of them gold, including a gold in the 4x200 freestyle relay in Rio. Thatâ€™s more medals than Mark Spitz. In fact, no swimmer in Olympic history has won more medals than Lochte  â€”   except Michael Phelps, with an astounding 28. Lochte and Phelps are less than a year apart in age, and Lochteâ€™s performances have always played out in the wake of Phelpsâ€™ unprecedented achievements. Lochteâ€™s been great, but not quite as great as Phelps. Stories about Lochte tend to focus on his   attitude, his love of nightlife or his   hair that turned green in the pools of Rio. Well, he finally eclipsed Phelps, for all the wrong reasons. Phelps had to deal with his own demons out of the water. He got his second DUI in 2014, and responded by going to rehab, coming out of retirement and rededicating himself to swimming. With his fiancee in Rio cheering him on and their child in her arms, Phelps appeared more grounded and focused than four years ago. Lochte, in contrast, seemed plagued by an ailment that afflicts many athletes who never quite know how to handle themselves away from their tightly regimented training routines. His Rio Games over, it was time for a   party. Why not? Itâ€™s great to be young and celebrated and recognized by everyone at the Olympic Games. Yet after his remarkable career, he is likely to be best remembered for a bit of   mischief that he then turned into an international incident. A silly story worthy of a reality TV show: Ryan Lochte Did WHAT?"
164918,372,primary,28,"Top officials at the U. S. Department of Agriculture didnâ€™t even try to act enthusiastic as they unveiled details of their agencyâ€™s proposed 2018 budget, which includes drastic cuts in spending. â€Weâ€™re going to do the best we can,â€ said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. â€Itâ€™s my job to implement that plan.â€ The broad outlines of this budget, with its 20 percent cut in the USDAâ€™s discretionary spending, had been released two months ago. This week, it became clear exactly what the Trump administration wants to cut: agricultural research, food aid for the poor, and programs that benefit small rural communities. The budget also includes a surprise thatâ€™s particularly unwelcome to big Midwestern farmers. It proposes new restrictions on   crop insurance, a program that is particular favorite of grain farmers. The changes, which would require congressional approval, would limit the ability of large farmers to take advantage of those programs and cut government subsidies by more than $2. 5 billion each year. In a statement, the American Farm Bureau Federation said that â€this budget fails agriculture and rural America.â€ Similar criticism came from the American Soybean Association and the National Corn Growers Association. The impact of those cuts, however, is dwarfed by proposed restrictions on the SNAP program, which helps the poor buy food. Those changes would cut SNAP spending by $4. 6 billion in 2018, increasing to more than $20 billion annually by 2022. The budget reduces funding for the Agricultural Research Service by $360 million, or 26 percent. This would mean closing the doors at 17 research centers. It also completely eliminates the countryâ€™s flagship program of international food aid, called Food For Peace. The current USDA budget includes $1. 7 billion for that program. All of this, of course, is merely a proposal for Congress to consider, and by all indications, Congress is inclined to reject much of it. The Republican chairmen of the agricultural committees in both the Senate and the House released a muted joint statement that said nothing at all about the proposal itself, but promised to â€fight to ensure farmers have a strong safety net.â€ They also pledged â€to take a look at our nutrition assistance programs to ensure that they are helping the most vulnerable in our societyâ€  â€”   a signal that they hope to revive the   coalition in Congress that has traditionally defended a package of food aid and farm subsidies. Congressman Collin Peterson ( ) said in a statement that â€this budget is going nowhere on Capitol Hill but it is still a statement of priorities and should be of concern to all rural Americans.â€ Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( ) called it â€harsh and  .â€"

168613,382,secondary,403,"Raed Saleh, a Syrian national, landed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on Monday afternoon after an   journey from Turkey. In his passport was a visa for the U. S. He was planning to attend a Tuesday evening banquet in the capital where he was being honored for his rescue work in Syria. But as Saleh tried to make his way through immigration, he says, he was pulled aside by security at the airport. â€After about two or three hours, they told me, â€™We apologize but you must return to Turkey because this visa has been canceled. Itâ€™s not valid.â€™ I told them, â€™How isnâ€™t it valid? Itâ€™s good for six months.â€™ â€ Saleh says the immigration official could not tell him why he was being turned back. â€He told me, â€™I donâ€™t have any explanation or details. I canâ€™t tell you anything,â€™ â€ according to Saleh, who spoke to NPR via Skype. He was in Geneva, on his way back to Turkey. Saleh had to head back without the award he was to receive from InterAction, an alliance of international humanitarian and aid agencies. Saleh heads up Syria Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, a collection of 2, 800 volunteer rescue workers who help victims caught up in the war. â€Their group really responds when buildings have been damaged from bombings or other kind of strikes and they go in and they pull people out of the rubble,â€ says Nancy Wilson, the head of Relief International, which nominated Saleh for the award. Wilson says the awards dinner carried on without Saleh  â€”   but many in the audience honored him by wearing white helmets, the trademark of his group. Wilson says sheâ€™s surprised Saleh wasnâ€™t allowed into the U. S. â€He has been to the United States before, spoken at the U. N. Security Council, was allowed on the plane  â€”   which is not an easy thing in Turkey to begin with because they scrutinize your visa papers there,â€ she says. â€And then for him to get here, and then not be able to actually be allowed in the country is just very disappointing.â€ The   question is why Saleh was turned back. The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement saying a number of U. S. agencies have a say in determining whether someone can enter the country. They include the State Department and law enforcement agencies. The keynote speaker at the dinner was Gayle Smith, who heads the U. S. governmentâ€™s Agency for International Development. But she didnâ€™t shed any light on the matter. For his part, Saleh says he felt demoralized by the incident, but knows itâ€™s not unusual for Syrians traveling abroad. â€Honestly, this is a problem across the board,â€ he says. â€For the Syrians in any airport in the world. Itâ€™s become common.â€ One of Salehâ€™s colleagues will deliver the award to him in Istanbul. Alison Meuse in Beirut contributed to this story."
184563,383,primary,180," Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, John Podesta, on Tuesday appeared before the U. S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which has begun interviewing witnesses in its probe of how Russia may have influenced the 2016 election. Committee members declined to comment on the discussion to reporters as they left the panelâ€™s secure hearing room. Podesta stopped and commented briefly. â€They asked me to come forward to give to the best of my knowledge what I knew about that, and I was happy to cooperate with the committee in their investigation of Russian interference with the democratic process in the United States,â€ he said. Republican President Donald Trump, who defeated Clinton in the election, recently has accused former Democratic President Barack Obama of doing too little to address Russian cyber attacks while he was still in the White House. On Monday, Trump demanded on Twitter that investigators apologize for looking to Russian interference and possible collusion with his campaign. He accused Obama of having â€colluded or obstructed,â€ without providing evidence. [nL1N1JN12O] Asked whether he thought Obama had done enough, Podesta said, â€I think the president and the entire administration were dealing with an unprecedented incidence of the weaponization of the fruits of Russian cyber activity and making the best judgments they could on behalf of the American people.â€ During the 2016 campaign, hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s email server and separately stole emails from Podestaâ€™s personal account. The emails were then posted online and used to embarrass Clinton, including by Trump, who frequently used their content as political ammunition. U. S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was behind the hacking and that it was seeking to boost Trumpâ€™s chances of winning the White House. Russia has denied trying to influence the election, and Trump has dismissed such allegations as sour grapes by Democrats and their supporters unable to come to terms with his surprise victory in November.

The bureau also wants to shield its data storehouse from other Privacy Act rules, including one that lets people ensure that the information the government holds about them is accurate. The proposed exemptions, published in May in the Federal Register, have stirred objections from an array of privacy and civil rights advocates. They say that such   remove a critical check on the use of the huge database in criminal investigations. In particular, advocates are concerned about the bureauâ€™s deployment of     technology to identify potential suspects.

According to figures supplied by the FBI, 43 percent of all federal arrests and 52 percent of all state arrests  â€”   or 51 percent of all arrests in NGI  â€”   lack final dispositions, such as whether a person has been convicted or even charged. Some of those people, the advocates say, might not be criminals, but the mere fact of having an arrest can disqualify them from a job. The bureau notes that it has been working on improving disposition rates, but that it often takes years for a criminal case to be disposed of, whether through a conviction or dismissal. They also say that they are not applying the exemptions to fingerprints not held as part of criminal records. Allowing criminal background checks to be run against records that do not indicate whether a person was ultimately found innocent or guilty â€œis a remarkable violation of due process,â€ said Alvaro Bedoya, executive director of Georgetown Universityâ€™s Center on Privacy and Technology"
212407,398,primary,524,"[FBI prepares vast databases of biometrics]  Bedoya said that the federal rule cited by the FBI and Justice Department that enables a person to obtain his criminal record is less effective than the Privacy Act, which requires the federal government to respond promptly to citizensâ€™ requests for corrections. The cited regulation leaves that job to the states â€œand allows that process to go on indefinitely,â€ he said. â€œThe big concern is that the FBI is proposing to exempt NGI from any requirement that they update or correct data about somebody in the future,â€ said Jennifer Lynch, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The coalition also is concerned that legal immigrants will have their fingerprints in the database, searched millions of times a year, along with other criminal and civilian prints. This violates the principle of equal treatment under the law, Bedoya said. The group also pointed to 2012 research that found that   technology has lower rates of accuracy for black people, women and young people"

211320,401,secondary,866,"     When Nathan Ross Chapman became the first military casualty to die by enemy fire during the war in Afghanistan, the only American flag available for his casket was a patch torn off the uniform of an airman loading his coffin for the long trip home. He was buried on Jan. 11, 2002, a week after his death, with full military honors in Tahoma National Cemetery, Wash. It took another 13 years for the CIA to recognize on its Memorial Wall that Chapman, an Army Green Beret, was also one of its own  â€”   the sergeant first class had been officially detailed to the agency in the weeks after the   attacks and died acting as a CIA paramilitary teamâ€™s communications specialist. Chapmanâ€™s death was a watershed event for a country that didnâ€™t know it was headed into a seemingly endless war, where the news of those lost would turn into a kind of white noise for many Americans. The first of its kind in Afghanistan, his death drew national attention, including a televised funeral. Much of Chapmanâ€™s story and that of the secret agency team he was assigned to has never been told, and the agency continues to say nothing about him"
211320,402,primary,618,"  SFC Nathan Ross Chapman (Photo courtesy Chapman family)  At a ceremony at CIA headquarters on May 18, 2015, the agency unveiled an engraved marble star to mark his death in the line of service, but like many others in the wallâ€™s accompanying Book of Honor, his name was left absent. The addition of that star for service in 2002 prompted The Post to examine the background to the honor, and why it had taken so long to be conferred. In the years after Chapman died, the agency honored at least one other service member, a Marine officer killed in Iraq in 2007 while detailed to an agency paramilitary unit. The Marine was later memorialized with a star, yet it took more than a decade for Chapman to receive his place on the famed wall. â€œWe didnâ€™t even know anything was going on relative to that star; we didnâ€™t expect it and we didnâ€™t know anything about it,â€ Chapmanâ€™s father, Will, said during a recent interview in his home in Texas. He said the recognition from the CIA was part of his sonâ€™s final chapter, and he was grateful for it. It also recognizes the pivotal role that Special Operations forces played with the CIA in the early days of the Afghan war. Following the memorial ceremony in 2015, CIA Director John Brennan, along with his deputies, privately met with the Chapmans on the agencyâ€™s seventh floor. He apologized for the long wait but gave no explanation for why it took more than 13 years for Chapman to get his place on the wall, the father said. â€œHe just said it should have been done a long time ago. â€ The CIA declined to comment. Chapman, 31, left behind a wife, Renae, and two children, Brandon and Amanda, who, at the time, were 1 and 2 years old. Renae Chapman was unavailable to comment for this story. A veteran who jumped into Panama as a Ranger and who served in Iraq and Haiti, Chapman was also a qualified combat scuba diver and sniper. Among his peers he was known as a consummate professional and as the life of the party with a penchant for quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. Chapman had transferred back to Fort Lewis, Wash. from Okinawa just before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. â€œAmericaâ€™s going to war over this,â€ he told his father in the weeks that followed. â€œAnd theyâ€™re not going without me. â€ â€œAnd then he was gone,â€ the elder Chapman recalled"

(courtesy Chapman family)  An unconventional team of elites Built like a linebacker with a square jaw, narrow eyes and a sly smile, Chapman went to war as a member of what the CIA called Team Hotel  â€”   a   unit composed of three Special Forces soldiers, two CIA paramilitary officers and a CIA contractor. Chapman and two other Green Berets were selected from more than 1, 300 soldiers in 1st Special Forces Group. For their mission in Afghanistan, the CIA needed communications specialists and medics, and almost immediately following the   attacks it tapped 1st Group to help fill that requirement, said Lt. Gen. David Fridovich, who was, at the time, the groupâ€™s commander and a colonel. Chapmanâ€™s assignment to Hotel reflected the agencyâ€™s rapidly expanding relationship with the U. S. military, according to Henry Crumpton, the leader of the CIAâ€™s Counterterrorism Center task force that led the war in Afghanistan. It was a relationship born out of necessity in order to field an effective unconventional force in a new and entirely unconventional war. After purchasing thousands of dollars in outdoor supplies from area sporting goods stores and requesting the weapons and equipment the team would need in Afghanistan, the six men spent the remainder of October bouncing between the CIAâ€™s Camp Perry  â€”   better known as The Farm  â€”   in Williamsburg, Va. and the agencyâ€™s headquarters Chapman was responsible for assembling the teamâ€™s communication equipment. At the time, the process of interfacing satellite radios and computers was a new discipline, but it was something Chapman had already mastered. He was known throughout 1st Special Forces group as the best in his field, earning the reputation during repeated deployments to places like Thailand and Malaysia with special forces teams. Aside from setting up the radios, Chapman was also instructed on a computer program called ArcView  â€”   a piece of software that allowed CIA and military units to see what was happening on the battlefield in real time. â€œHe never took himself too seriously, even with all the crap we were throwing at him,â€ said Ken Stiles, the CIA targeting officer for all of the agencyâ€™s operations in Afghanistan. In the   to Hotelâ€™s departure, other CIA and Special Forces teams had already been scattered throughout Afghanistan. Team Jawbreaker, the first element to go in, had linked up with parts of the Northern Alliance fighting the Taliban, along with teams Bravo and Charlie. Team Echo had made contact with future Afghan president Hamid Karzai. In December, teams Juliet and Romeo would go into Tora Bora, hoping to corner Osama bin Laden in the craggy mountain passes near the Pakistan border. But before Hotel would join its sister elements in Afghanistan, Chapman and the rest of the team would first fly to Jacobabad, Pakistan. The team soon began trying to work a deal with the Pakistani military to get to their side of the border south of the Afghan city of Jalalabad in an attempt to box in and find bin Laden, according to Scott Satterlee, a special forces medic detailed to Hotel with Chapman. With the Pakistani military demanding more training and equipment than the small team was able to provide and offering little knowledge of the lawless border region where Hotel was trying to go, the deal fell through. As things unraveled in Pakistan, U. S. and Afghan forces seized Kabul and, just days after Thanksgiving, Team Hotel left Pakistan for Afghanistanâ€™s capital. Hotel would stay in Kabul for roughly a month, spending Christmas there. A detachment of operators from Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, would bring the team to 11 members for an upcoming mission in Khost, a rugged town on Afghanistanâ€™s eastern border. Christmas was the last time Chapman called home, his father recalled. He didnâ€™t tell them where he was, just that he was safe. He passed the phone around to his mother Lynn, and to Keith Chapman, his older brother who was recently married. His grandmother and grandfather also managed to get on the line. â€œI said to him at the end of the conversation, Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re not able to be with your family,â€ his father said. â€œI know, Dad,â€ he replied. â€œBut Iâ€™m with my second family, and theyâ€™re a great bunch of guys. â€    A copy of this painting was given to the Chapman family and signed by members of Team Hotel following Chapmanâ€™s death. It depicts a standard CIA operation in the early days of the war in Afghanistan (Courtesy James Dietz)  Behind enemy lines Roughly a week later, Hotel loaded onto one of the CIAâ€™s     helicopters and flew the 90 miles to Khost. According to Satterlee, the agency had to pay its way into the town, offering large sums of money to one of the tribes in exchange for admission and some protection. Hotel would go in and â€œplant the flagâ€ for the CIA and deny   a base of operations, according to a CIA officer present during the teamâ€™s operations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a covert operation. They were the first Americans there since the war began. The team set up, along with some of their newly acquired Afghan escorts, a rudimentary base of operations in an old Russian schoolhouse in the middle of town during the final days of the year. The night before Chapmanâ€™s death, a small   element from Hotel slipped into the darkness to conduct reconnaissance on an abandoned Soviet airfield a few miles away, returning after taking   fire. The airfield would later be named after Chapman and was the site of a suicide bombing that killed seven CIA employees in 2009. The next morning, cold and cloudless, Hotelâ€™s team leader along with a senior CIA officer who had been sent to the area held a meeting with some of the tribal leaders at a nearby abandoned government building. The meeting started poorly, according to the CIA officer. The tribeâ€™s representatives erupted into heated argument, but after tea and a pledge by the CIA to help rebuild the town, the meeting closed on somewhat good terms, said the officer. That afternoon, Hotel loaded into four white Toyota Hillux pickup trucks along with a handful of Afghan escorts and headed to what they thought was an   safe house located in town. The agency had intercepted communications coming from the building. â€œUs being there wasnâ€™t accomplishing anything, besides maybe getting us into more trouble,â€ Satterlee said"
211320,404,primary,56,"  Two Afghans inside Team Hotelâ€™s Khost safe house circa 2002. (Photo courtesy Scott Satterlee)  The team got back in their trucks and headed down one of the only paved roads in Khost. As they came into town, the road turned into a wash. The first three trucks went down and out and headed back toward the schoolhouse. As the fourth truck dipped into the culvert, now roughly a hundred yards away from the next vehicle in the convoy, three men opened up with Kalashnikovs, each dumping their entire magazines into the last truck from roughly 30 feet away. In that truckâ€™s bed was Chapman, a CIA paramilitary officer and the teamâ€™s lone CIA contractor. An Afghan was driving. Two rounds slammed into the paramilitary officerâ€™s chest, tearing through his extra ammunition magazines and his soft body armor. The bullet that killed Chapman shattered his pelvis and severed his femoral artery. It was unclear who returned fire, said Satterlee, but when they inventoried Chapmanâ€™s gear later that day, the magazine in his M4 carbine was empty with its bolt locked to the rear  â€”   evidence that he had expended every round he could before collapsing from blood loss. Chapman and the paramilitary officer slumped down, and the Afghan driver gunned it, making it back to the schoolhouse in just over a minute and half. By the time Satterlee and the rest of the team got to the back of the truck, it was awash in Chapmanâ€™s blood, and he was unconscious. With the agencyâ€™s lumbering   transport helicopter flying from Kabul  â€”   a roughly   flight from Khost  â€”   the team worked furiously to keep Chapman alive. Satterlee did the best he could by stuffing the wound with gauze while another team member knelt on Chapmanâ€™s navel. But five minutes before the Russian helicopter touched down in a wheat field next to the school, Chapman stopped breathing. The paramilitary officer, although severely injured with multiple sucking chest wounds, would survive. Satterlee helped slide Chapman into his sleeping bag and loaded him into the back of the helicopter. It was 5 p. m. Jan. 4, 2002. It is unclear exactly who shot Chapman and why. According to Satterlee, the gunmen were part of one of the tribes trying to extort more money from the Americans for protection, while the CIA officer interviewed for this article said they were possibly linked to the Haqqanis  â€”   a powerful faction that had already sworn to fight the United States and would continue to fight U. S. troops for years to come. â€œHe always knew how to find his way into the action,â€ his father said. â€œThatâ€™s why he went in the military, to do this stuff"
211320,405,primary,175," â€¦     But he knew the risk involved. â€ The Army awarded Chapman a Bronze Star with a V for valor, and the CIA would posthumously give him an intelligence star, according to his father. The U. S. Special Forces Association in Thailand renamed itself after Chapman, and a mural of the slain Green Beret adorns the wall of their headquarters. â€œThe mystique went away, and reality showed up when Nate died,â€ said his former teammate Sgt. 1st Class Jason Koehler. â€œIt took the Superman   from everyone of us who thought we were invincible. â€  "
172039,406,tertiary,148,"Artists are supposed to be unafraid. We want them to take those risks, symbolically and sometimes personally, that reasonable people would caution against: Defy physical limits. Risk offending others. Expose unmanageable emotions to the open air. Do these things, we say to our painters and writers and singers, so that we can imagine, through you, what it feels like. Martha Wainwright has risen to that challenge since she was 21 years old. Now sheâ€™s 40, the author of three stunning (and stunningly underrated) studio albums and numerous notable live works and collaborations. She has matured a mother of two, she has lived through the loss of her own mother, the legendary singer and songwriter Kate McGarrigle, and negotiated ongoing musical partnerships with her father, Loudon Wainwright III, and her siblings, Rufus Wainwright and Lucy Roche. Her own songwriting thrills with its honesty and enchants with its lyricism, grounded in her love of the American songbook, French chanson and the confessional   realm that was her home school. Her music evokes some obvious associations  â€”   Edith Piaf, whose songbook sheâ€™s interpreted extensively brother Rufusâ€™ similarly eclectic work  â€”   but those comparisons donâ€™t quite capture the unique blend of boldness and refinement Martha Wainwright projects. On her new album Goodnight City, her first solo effort since 2012, Wainwright maintains her sense of adventure while considering the adult responsibilities of raising children, staying married, facing intimate loss and maintaining a career. Produced by the bassist Brad Albetta (Wainwrightâ€™s husband) and Thomas â€Dovemanâ€ Bartlett (whoâ€™s worked with Sufjan Stevens and Sam Amidon, among many others) itâ€™s more sonically daring than anything Wainwright has previously released, while still delivering the sense of shared confidences that Wainwrightâ€™s fans adore. Its track listing is a blend of intriguing covers and collaborations. Contributors include the novelist Michael Ondaatje, Beth Orton, Merrill Garbus and Glen Hansard, plus various members of the   clan. The first song to be released from Goodnight City is â€Around The Bend,â€ an air evocative of both Kate Bush and of the   classics Wainwright sang as the lounge entertainer Angela in Lisa Cholodenkoâ€™s   HBO adaptation of Elizabeth Stroutâ€™s Olive Kitteridge. From her home in Montreal, via email, Wainwright answered some questions about that song, her voice and life in one of North Americaâ€™s most beloved musical families. Ann Powers: Youâ€™ve sung tributes to Edith Piaf, and in your own writing  â€”   including â€Around The Bendâ€  â€”   you often confront intense emotional states from a feminine point of view. What kind of artistic resonance does this focus offer? What risks is taking it on? Martha Wainwright: Iâ€™ve tried to write songs that werenâ€™t about my life and what Iâ€™m going through. â€Around The Bendâ€ is an example of a song where Iâ€™m trying to not be so revealing. Iâ€™ve written a lot of songs that were so personal they got me into trouble. Iâ€™m not very good at making things up. In my daily life I try to be very in control and not dramatic, so when I sing I often go for it as a way to express all the feelings inside that I am trying to negotiate. Maybe thatâ€™s why sometimes my music is fraught. As for Piaf  â€”   considering her life, no wonder she sang like that! Being a woman in this business is hard, and trying to steer a career in music and have kids is really hard. Youâ€™ve developed a unique singing style in which you often push your range in various ways. What have been your biggest vocal influences? How have you modified or modulated your singing approach over the years? I always have had trouble with my voice. I lose it often itâ€™s a chameleon, yet itâ€™s particular to me. It is a true expression of who I am. Iâ€™ve really enjoyed trying different things with it and have suffered greatly when it goes. I push it to its limits and only recently have learned to control it and protect it a bit better. Iâ€™ve tried to mock all the great singers, male and female, but very quickly on my voice became distinct. Distinct in its range and in that it never seems quite in check. You and your siblings and friends often devise interesting frameworks for performance, whether itâ€™s the lullaby project you did with your sister Lucy or your recent â€Noel Nightsâ€ shows with Rufus. Whatâ€™s the relationship between these projects and your own songwriting? How does one form of creativity, interpretation, influence the other, authorship? Because music is such an integral part of our lives, it seems normal to do in many ways. You kind of turn into a von Trapp! We always sang a lot at Christmas and singing is what we do, so why not do Christmas on stage? In the case of the Christmas shows we raise money for my momâ€™s cancer foundation. Singing together and different kinds of music, like old timey music or jazz, is also very normal to us because [we were] brought up in the tradition of folk  â€”   singing together is required and expected. There is â€the self,â€ writing and singing in a distinct voice, and then there is group singing, where the goal is to blend and not stick out per se. Iâ€™ve always interpreted other singers with the goal of making it my own or just serving the songs best. Sometimes itâ€™s best to just sing it plainly, without flourishes. I think it is a question of learning how to intuit what is the best for the song and the occasion of that moment. Sometimes itâ€™s standing quietly with your eyes closed or focusing more on laying tightly with a band other times itâ€™s doing a cartwheel on stage. Singing great songs demands that you at least are very aware of great songwritersâ€™ genius. I always hope that that will seep into my own writing somehow. I loved you as the lounge singer in Olive Kitteridge. You were singing material that many people have dubbed â€cheesyâ€ over the years, but with the utmost respect and tenderness. Do you relate to the figure of the lounge singer? What can we learn from her? I often imagine that my destiny is to become a lounge singer, and it could happen. Since I started, Iâ€™ve always sung standards with a piano player, and itâ€™s often a part of my set. There is something a bit sad and lonely about it that I feel relates to my life. I hope to be singing the pain away for a long time. What can we learn from Angela in Olive Kitteridge? Be yourself, and donâ€™t aim too high because the fall could be devastating. I like that sheâ€™s just doing her thing and sheâ€™s not too desperate. Youâ€™ve worked in a family context your whole life, first with your parents and now with your husband, and always with your siblings. This was standard for entertainers for much of the past couple of centuries, but we donâ€™t see it so much anymore. How has being in a â€family bandâ€ fed your individual projects? Do you hope to continue the lineage with your own children? Because everyone around me was always making music, I felt the need to stand out. Maybe that is why my music is a little aggressive or different. Standing out was hard and individualism was important in order to survive. A part of me hopes that my kids do something else because it might mean an easier life for them, but already I see the joy music can bring them. Especially our oldest, who has some difficulties. When he is experiencing music, something is unblocked in him and he flourishes. Goodnight City comes out Nov. 11 on PIAS."

196199,408,secondary,20, It turns out Donald Trump may not be looking for a fight with China after all
196199,409,tertiary,306,"  Just weeks after questioning a cornerstone of Washingtonâ€™s diplomatic relationship with Beijing, Trump used a Thursday night phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to say that he would honor the   â€œOne Chinaâ€ policy that has kept ties between the two superpowers on an even keel since 1979. In December, Trump had raised doubts about his commitment to the agreement  â€”   and infuriated many in Beijing  â€”   by speaking by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai  . That was a big deal in diplomatic circles because no US president had spoken to a Taiwanese leader in decades due to the One China policy. The policy acknowledges Beijingâ€™s stance that it alone represents Chinaâ€™s national government and that the island of Taiwan is a breakaway province that belongs to China. All of Trumpâ€™s recent predecessors had only unofficial diplomatic ties with Taiwan, and Trumpâ€™s direct conversation with Tsai broke with that practice. Trump escalated things further when, a few days later, he refused to apologize for the call or back away from his apparent belief that the One China policy wasnâ€™t set in stone"
196199,410,primary,21,"  â€I fully understand the One China policy, but I donâ€™t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,â€ Trump said"
196199,411,tertiary,350,"   At the time, Trump also correctly noted that the US sells billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of military equipment to Taiwan. China doesnâ€™t like that either  â€”   but itâ€™s not considered a violation of the One China policy. Beijing pushed back swiftly against Trump, indicating that scuttling One China was a   and declaring that if the policy was ever placed on the negotiating table, talks over all other issues would immediately end"
196199,412,primary,339,"   As the Washington Post notes, itâ€™s hard to say if Trump got anything in return for what amounts to a   after his tough talk on dropping the One China policy. Rhetoric on Chinaâ€™s side was vague as well. â€œThe development of China and the United States can complement each other and promote each other, and the two countries are totally capable of becoming good cooperative partners,â€ Xi said, according to the state news agency Xinhua. Why Beijing is so committed to the One China policy For the Chinese government, preserving One China wasnâ€™t just about diplomacy, but also about protecting its own legitimacy against nationalists always on the lookout for signs the country is being disrespected or bullied by the US"
196199,413,secondary,335,"Recent statements from Trumpâ€™s team have only added to their concern. During his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hinted at the idea of setting up a blockade against Chinaâ€™s navy in the South China Sea, which some nationalists in China interpreted as an invitation to war. And reports have emerged that Trumpâ€™s chief strategist Steve Bannon had predicted the US would go to war with China in the South China Sea as recently as nine months ago"
196199,414,tertiary,45,"    Needless to say, tensions were on the rise in the run up to Trumpâ€™s call with Xi, which had been a long time coming. It was the first conversation between the two leaders since Trump took office, and the 19th world leader that the president has spoken to or met with since Inauguration Day"
196199,415,tertiary,135,"The call took place one day after Trump first extended his hand to China, when National Security Adviser Michael Flynn   a letter to Chinaâ€™s ambassador saying the US was looking forward to building â€œconstructive relationsâ€ with China"
196199,416,tertiary,5,"The White House said Trump and Xi had a lengthy,   talk that was â€œextremely cordial,â€ and that both leaders invited each other for a visit. The readout of the call contained no substantive details except this: â€œPresident Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our â€˜one Chinaâ€™ policy. â€  Thereâ€™s a very good chance that Trump realized that gambling on using the One China policy as a bargaining chip was too risky, given how adamant Beijing was that it could potentially end up causing a severing of ties between them. Thereâ€™s also the fact that China is extremely large, extremely powerful, and has a huge web of economic ties with the US  â€”   something that explains why itâ€™s easier to talk about reining in China than it is to do something about it. â€œEvery US president since Nixon has come into office promising to be tough on China, and every single one of them has backed off when they realize the complexity of the situation,â€ David Kang, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California, told me during an interview in January. Trump has shown a tendency to be extraordinarily antagonistic with some of the USâ€™s closest allies, like when he gratuitously insulted the prime minister of Australia. But his first call with China showed uncommon prudence and restraint. Itâ€™s also the first call in days that wasnâ€™t immediately followed by key details of the conversation leaking to the press. In other words, it was a double win of sorts for a new president desperately in search of a victory. "

200876,418,primary,205,"  The New York Times reports that in the coming weeks, Bush will be campaigning for Sens. Roy Blunt ( ) Ron Johnson ( ) and Rob Portman ( ). Since Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Bush has also participated in fundraisers for Sens. Kelly Ayotte ( ) and John McCain ( ). Bushâ€™s decision to participate in the election cycle marks a stark shift from his previous abstention from politics since the end of his second term in 2008. Aside from minor campaigning for his brother Jeb during the Republican primaries, Bush has mostly stayed under the radar  â€”   until now. The likely reason is that until recently his unfavorability among the general public overshadowed the value of his endorsement. Years after leaving office, his approval ratings seem to be on the rise. According to a 2015 CNN poll, 52 percent of Americans had a favorable impression of him, up from 2009 when only around a third of the public approved of him"

But the excavation of the cave found evidence of eels, frogs, fish, birds and small mammals, which had been charred, suggesting consumption by humans, in various layers of rock. Researchers believe this and the other findings of their excavation indicates the island has been nearly continuously occupied since 35, 000 years ago. As well as the   and remains of animals, researchers also found human remains, seashell beads, as well as something they believe might have been a grindstone. The discovery of the charred remains of the crab is also significant, say the researchers, in that it provides evidence of seasonal eating habits. The size of the crab remains indicate they were captured in the autumn when they were larger and were migrating downstream for reproduction, which is â€œalso the season when they are the most deliciousâ€."

194652,436,primary,440," European Union leaders agreed their plan for Brexit negotiations on Thursday, pledging to move swiftly and stick together to ensure Britain does not cherry pick a sweet deal that might inspire others to unstitch the bloc. Prime Minister Theresa May left before the other 27 leaders met briefly to formalize their plan for how to run Brexit talks. Before heading home, diplomats said May had assured her European partners that she would launch the   process by the end of March despite how London judges rule in a constitutional court case that some say might jeopardize her timetable. â€Itâ€™s right that the other leaders prepare for those negotiations as we have been preparing,â€ May told reporters. The 27 issued a statement saying they were â€determined to see the Union succeedâ€ and were ready to negotiate quickly to â€tackle the uncertaintiesâ€ raised by the prospect of Brexit. But â€any agreement will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligationsâ€ they insisted, and reject British attempts to remain in the EUâ€™s single market if it does not accept free immigration from the continent   one of four key freedoms of the Union which British voters rejected in a June referendum. After months in which exasperated continentals have mocked divisions within Mayâ€™s government over what kind of deal Britain should seek, her exhortations to the others to get on with their preparations sounded a shade ironic. But in fact Brussels did see a wobble in its facade of unity as the European Parliament grumbled that EU leaders were freezing it out of negotiations. After warnings from senior lawmakers that the legislature risked withholding its consent to any final divorce deal if it was not included throughout the talks, national leaders offered an olive branch, saying they could attend preparatory meetings. â€™SMOOTHâ€™ EXIT May, who was filmed looking unsure of herself as leaders gathered, left the summit with no mention of Brexit, focusing instead on Syria and a pledge to provide a further 20 million pounds (23. 8 million euros) of support for the most vulnerable fleeing Aleppo. She had sought to reinforce her message that, while still a member, Britain would play a full part in discussions on EU issues and keen to set a conciliatory tone for a â€smoothâ€ exit, welcoming the meeting of the other EU leaders without her. The EU negotiating plan confirmed that a special set of institutions would be set up, mirroring existing EU forums but excluding Britain. Ministerial councils and councils of envoys would meet to keep national governments in overall control of negotiations led by French former minister Michel Barnier, the point man for the European Commission, the EU executive. EU governments are pressing May to start talks. But they are also perplexed by what they see as unrealistic ideas in Britain about what can be achieved by a complex and unprecedented exit  that even few of its supporters thought likely before the vote. Some British ministers say they can secure a free trade deal with the EU by the time the   withdrawal process is over. Few EU leaders share that view and nor do many British officials. Typically such deals can take up to a decade. The BBC quoted Britainâ€™s envoy to Brussels on Thursday as warning the government about such a timeframe"

160912,438,primary,84,"One of the most fragile pieces of President Obamaâ€™s legacy in the aftermath of the 2016 election is the Affordable Care Act. Republicans ran on their   pledge to repeal it, and weâ€™ll know soon whether  â€”   as promised  â€”   they make it their top priority in the new Congress, even without having released details on what would replace it. The history of the Affordable Care Act also provides a window into the earliest years of the Obama presidency. Fierce opposition from the GOP was there even before work on the legislation began, and that battle featured an early form of fake news  â€”   a tactic that became a prominent part of the 2016 election. Remember the â€death panelsâ€? In 2009, when the health care law was still being written, Sarah Palin coined the phrase â€death panelâ€ in a widely shared Facebook post. The headline of her post was innocuous enough, â€Statement on the Current Health Care Debate.â€ But that Aug. 7, 2009, social media post from the former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate included a dire warning: â€The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obamaâ€™s â€™death panelâ€™ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their â€™level of productivity in society.â€™ â€ Conservative   pages were on board. Talk radio, too. On his syndicated national radio program, Rush Limbaugh said of Palin, â€Sheâ€™s dead right.â€ The specter of â€death panelsâ€ became an instant rallying cry for the   Tea Party movement, whose supporters crowded into town hall meetings that summer and shouted down Democratic lawmakers considering support for the Affordable Care Act. Republican members of Congress tapped into that anger. U. S. Sen. Chuck Grassley told a crowd back home in Iowa, â€We should not have a government program that determines youâ€™re gonna pull the plug on Grandma.â€ â€Simply dishonestâ€ As the summer of 2009 wore on, the president stayed above the fray. Anita Dunn, who was the White House communications director at the time, told NPR in a recent interview that the team didnâ€™t take the attacks seriously at first, â€simply because they did seem so crazy.â€ But the president himself would need to directly respond. He went on the road, first to a   town hall in Portsmouth, N. H. where he said that this is how politics works sometimes, â€that people who want to keep things the way they are will try to scare the heck out of folks, and theyâ€™ll create boogeymen out there that just arenâ€™t real.â€ Days later, in Grand Junction, Colo. Obama kept at it. â€The notion that somehow I ran for public office or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on Grandma? I mean when you start making arguments like that, thatâ€™s simply dishonest,â€ the president said. Ultimately, the Affordable Care Act was approved by the    Congress. The president signed it in the spring of 2010. Meanwhile, the allegations regarding â€death panelsâ€ would be â€Lie of the Yearâ€ by the   organization PolitiFact. The message that stuck, Dunn, currently a managing director at the D. C. firm SKDKnickerbocker, says that the early disinformation campaign had a lasting negative effect nonetheless. â€One of the hallmarks of the Affordable Care Act is that people donâ€™t know what is in the bill, or realize the benefits theyâ€™ve gotten,â€ Dunn says, adding, â€a huge part of that is how it was defined early by the opposition.â€ She says the White House communications team learned from the experience. Rapid response became more of a priority. But Ruy Teixeira, a senior analyst with the Center for American Progress, says thereâ€™s another lesson from those early Obamacare battles that the administration  â€”   and Democrats  â€”   have been slow to learn: how to talk to white voters who do not have a college education. Those voters were once a key piece of the Democratic base, but Teixeira says they are now too often driven by a core belief that â€the government is up to no good.â€ The idea of death panels fit right into that narrative. But Teixeira says you can apply it to other issues as well. â€Youâ€™ve got to convince them you take their concerns seriously, youâ€™re on their side,â€ he says, â€and the other people are not, and hereâ€™s exactly why.â€ That was a major weakness of Democrats in the 2016 election"

162494,447,tertiary,280,"Nora McInerny is tired of small talk. â€I donâ€™t want small talk . ..â€ she says on her podcast. â€I want the big talk.â€ McInernyâ€™s show is called Terrible, Thanks for Asking, and she begins each interview with the same question: How are you? The responses she gets go way beyond the typical â€Iâ€™m fine.â€ McInerny deals with death, loss and coming through trauma. But her approach to these tough subjects is saturated with love and humor. She shares (or, as she puts it  â€”   overshares) some of her stories with NPRâ€™s Ari Shapiro. On experiencing loss in her own life, Up until 2014 I had the most charmed, uneventful life that a person could possibly hope for. I think that if you looked up â€privilegeâ€ in the dictionary you would have seen my senior photo from high school. . .. In 2014 my husband died of brain cancer on November 25th. And six weeks before that, my father had died of all kinds of cancer. And five days before that, I had miscarried the second child that my husband and I were expecting and had conceived knowing that he had stage four brain cancer. Itâ€™s hard to just list those things off without sounding as if Iâ€™m minimizing it, but at some point in time, that just becomes your story. On how people react to someone who has experienced a loss, [People ask] â€Oh, how are you?â€ And nobody actually wants to hear: â€Well, I frankly have been staying up all night watching Gilmore Girls and drinking a box of white wine that is almost gone.â€ . .. But now I know that . .. itâ€™s almost impossible to know the right thing to say, and that even if people say the wrong thing it is a sign that theyâ€™re trying. The worst thing  â€”   and it doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re dealing with death, or if youâ€™re dealing with all of these other things that weâ€™ve talked to people about  â€”   silence is the worst thing you can hear from people. On her instinct to find humor even in sad times, I think part of it is how I was raised. My father was very funny and very dry. And so he was in the ICU and the nurse walked in and said, â€Steve how are you doing?â€ And he was on a respirator. But he said slowly, â€Iâ€™m kind of dying hereâ€  â€”   because he was. . .. She was so horrified. And all my brothers and sister and I were laughing . .. because of course that was my dad  â€”   and thatâ€™s how Aaron was, too. He was definitely a favorite on the oncology floor and in the radiation department because he was always so funny . .. thatâ€™s how we got through. . .. In the E. R. after he had had a lot of seizures and we had yet to see an extremely attractive doctor Ã  la Greyâ€™s Anatomy and we were commenting on that. And the doctor walked in and he looked like a Ken doll. Aaron kept saying, â€I think that they hire him just to deliver bad news because itâ€™s hard to feel really bad when it comes from an incredibly handsome person.â€ I found out later that he is a doctor. On whether laughter can be perceived as inappropriate in the context of loss, Itâ€™s not as if I sit down trying to think, gosh how could we make this awful thing really funny? I think that those kinds of moments just happen naturally. . .. When it is your story you can find those little points of humor even in the worst things. I think thatâ€™s really common. Anyone whoâ€™s been through something really traumatic has probably also laughed at it. . .. We had this woman come in  â€”   it was literally the day after her husband had died. . .. She sat right down and she talked to us about her husband having died and we laughed together and she stopped herself and said, â€Iâ€™m afraid people will think Iâ€™m terrible for laughing right now.â€ And of course not  â€”   you are allowed to feel all of the things all at once. I think her fear was being judged for that. On the way painful experiences can connect us, I am reminded every day  â€”   because I sort of choose to surround myself with these stories  â€”   that Iâ€™m not special. The experiences, the pain that I have, itâ€™s obviously unique to me. We all have our own. But it doesnâ€™t make me and it doesnâ€™t make me different from other people. I had sort of wrapped Aaronâ€™s death and my dadâ€™s death around me like armor  â€”   like it was something that made me different from other people, that made me harder to understand. And the fact is that everybody has these kinds of pain  â€”   itâ€™s different brands for all of us, but that is a way of connecting. It has helped me look more tenderly on the people around me. I now am sort of more intentional about reminding myself that we all carry something, and that we are, for the most part, all doing our best."
170400,448,secondary,197,"At the center of Geel, a charming Belgian town less than an hourâ€™s drive from of Antwerp, is a church dedicated to Dymphna, a saint believed to have the power to cure mental disorders. Itâ€™s a medieval church with stone arches, spires and a   bell tower, and it has inspired an unusual   practice: For over 700 years, residents of Geel have been accepting people with mental disorders, often very severe mental disorders, into their homes and caring for them. It isnâ€™t meant to be a treatment or therapy. The people are not called patients, but guests or boarders. They go to Geel and join households to share a life with people who can watch over them. Today, there are about 250 boarders in Geel. One of them is a Flemish man named Luc Ennekans. Heâ€™s slim and has green eyes, and heâ€™s 51 years old. NPRâ€™s Lulu Miller went to Geel and met him and his host family there and reported this story for Invisibilia. Like all of the guests in the town today, Ennekans first went to a public psychiatric hospital in Geel that manages the boarder program. Ennekans saw medical professionals and received treatment and an evaluation. Then he was paired with a household. His hosts, Toni Smit and Arthur Shouten, say that living with Ennekans was rough at the start. Ennekans became deeply attached to Smit. â€If it were up to Luc, he would be hugging and kissing me all day,â€ Smit says. He showered her with such affection, bringing her flowers, little kisses, linking arms with her on walks, that it began to interfere with Smit and Shoutenâ€™s marriage. â€You couldnâ€™t even give each other a hug or Luc is standing behind us,â€ Shouten says. Wrinkles like this are common, according to the couple. Theyâ€™ve had six boarders over the years, each with a unique set of challenges. One boarder used to lock Smit and Shouten out of the bathroom to furiously wash his hands, and another used to struggle to sleep because he saw lions coming out of the walls. â€He was really dementing,â€ Smit says. But that doesnâ€™t affect the way they see their boarders. Like many hosts in Geel, they accept that this is simply who their boarders are. Itâ€™s not abnormal or something they need to change. â€Itâ€™s just normal life,â€ Shouten says. That acceptance of mental differences has become something of a tradition in Geel. Itâ€™s at the heart of the boarder program, and some observers think itâ€™s also responsible for the systemâ€™s success. Around the world, many different experiments have been attempted over the centuries to provide humane care for people with mental illness and mental disabilities. Geel is one that has endured. Residents of Geel have not only accepted the eccentric or disruptive behaviors of the boarders but have come up with creative ways to help boarders and residents manage them, says Ellen Baxter, the founder of Broadway Housing Communities, a nonprofit in New York City. It is partially inspired by Geel, which Baxter visited as a young woman. For example, when Ennekans became too jealous or attached to Smit, Shouten and Smit encouraged him to find a girlfriend or other companionship. When their former boarder hallucinated lions coming through the walls, Smit would pretend to chase the lions away. â€And that would work every time,â€ Smit says. Shouten and Smit receive a stipend from the Belgian government for taking care of Ennekans, as well as training and support from psychiatric professionals. Hospitalization is available if needed. Several studies have found that the incidence of violence by boarders is low people who have previously exhibited violent behavior are usually not admitted to the program. The integration of people with mental disorders into Geel society has fascinated scholars for centuries. In 1862, Dr. Louiseau, a visiting French doctor, described it as â€the extraordinary phenomenon presented at Geel of 400 insane persons moving freely about in the midst of a population which tolerates them without fear and without emotion.â€ Nearly 100 years after that, an American psychiatrist named Charles D. Aring wrote in the journal JAMA, â€The remarkable aspect of the Gheel experience, for the uninitiated[,] is the attitude of the citizenry.â€ Early psychiatrists who observed Geel noticed that the treatment prescribed for mental patients was, in fact, no treatment at all. â€To them, treating the insane, meant to simply live with them, share their work, their distractions,â€   Moreau wrote in 1845. He and others advocated for that communion. â€In a colony, like in Geel, the crazy people . .. have not completely lost their dignity as reasonable human beings.â€ In the next   many would uphold Geelâ€™s model as the best standard of practice for mental disorders. How Geel came to be this way begins with the townâ€™s devotion to St. Dymphna, whose church stands in the center of town. According to legend, Dymphna was a   Irish princess who fled to Geel from a maddened father and devoted her life to serving the mentally disabled. But she became a martyr when her father discovered her location and traveled to Geel to behead her. The town built St. Dymphnaâ€™s church in the 14th century to honor the saint and enshrine her supposed remains. It became a popular pilgrimage site for people across Europe, who would bring loved ones to the shrine in the hopes of finding relief from their mental distress. By 1480, the town had built a small hospice on the side of the church to accommodate pilgrims, but the shrine became so popular that the pilgrims overwhelmed the annexâ€™s capacity. â€Sometimes the families would return home and leave their uncured relatives in the hospice,â€ says Mike Jay, a historian of psychiatry and curator for the Wellcome Collection in London, who has studied Geel. â€So local people began taking them in as guests or boarders, as they call them.â€ The early practice was often mutually beneficial for both the hosts and the boarders, Jay says. Many Geel residents were farmers, and boarders offered a source of labor. In exchange, the boarders got stable housing and a family life. But the integration was not always a happy one. There are stories of abuse, Jay says. â€One of the laws was that if a boarder committed a crime, it was the fault of the family. If you had a boarder who was difficult, then some of the families would resort to keeping them chained or restrained.â€ As medical treatment for the mentally ill evolved, so did Geel. In the 19th century, a central medical establishment was set up that provided standard medical and psychiatric care to boarders and other residents. But this was at the same time that large insane asylums were considered the most advanced, scientific form of care. Geel became the source of a great debate in psychiatry. â€It was a polarizing example,â€ Jay says. â€Some people regarded Geel as a sad remnant of old medieval culture where people were left to toil in the field and never given therapy and no chance of recovery.â€ Other early observers noted the same things that Baxter and other more recent visitors have: By and large, people in Geel were happy. â€One of the agreeable features is the general contentment manifested by the insane,â€ wrote John Sibbald, a Scottish psychiatrist, in 1861. By the turn of the 20th century, the International Congress of Psychiatry had declared Geel an example of best practice to be copied elsewhere. The program continued to be a source of local pride, and it grew. At the programâ€™s peak in 1930, about 4, 000 boarders resided in Geel  â€”   a quarter of the townâ€™s population. Over time, Jay says, boarders had become such a part of life and society that distinctions between them and nonboarders blurred. And with that, â€a lot of the problems we associate [with mental illness] kind of fade away,â€ Jay says. â€Like trying to navigate a world full of kind of normal people who donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s going on and arenâ€™t tolerant towards it.â€ There are a few important criteria for acceptance into the Geel program. The program typically selects patients with severe mental illness or cognitive disabilities who have difficulty living independently. In 2003, almost half of the townâ€™s 516 boarders had a cognitive disability, and over 20 percent carry a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, according to research by Jackie Goldstein, a professor emeritus of psychology at Samford University. Some boarders have traditionally had other conditions such as learning disabilities or autism. While scholarship of Geel is rich with observation, there remain few   empirical studies on how these patients do in the system. â€The successes and shortcomings of Geelâ€™s system of foster family care had never been thoroughly or systematically examined,â€ Goldstein noted in a speech presented at the American Psychological Association Annual Convention in 1998. In the 1960s, researchers embarked on a   project studying Geel that Goldstein took part in, but it never reached completion. Goldstein continued studying Geel throughout her life, and some of her work shows that boarder life is stable. Boarders tend to stay in family care for years. In some cases, when boardersâ€™ caretakers grow too old or die, they continue to live with their caretakersâ€™ children. In 2005, nearly a third of boarders lived in a foster home for more than 50 years. But the   custom has been shrinking. The number of boarders has fallen to roughly 250 today, less than 7 percent of its prewar peak. Eugeen Roosens, a Belgian psychiatrist, and Lieve Van De Walle, a former director for rehabilitation in Geel, write, â€the time of extended farmer families, who could do with a helping hand, is gone,â€ in their book, Geel Revisited: After Centuries of Mental Rehabilitation. There are possible reasons for the programâ€™s decline besides the time and professional pressures of modern life. There may be fewer patients who need supported living thanks to improved psychiatric medication, which might contribute to fewer referrals to the program. Roosens and Van De Walle also note the program lacks enough funding to cover the cost of a boarder. The Belgian government pays 40 euros (less than $45) per boarder per day to support the practice, less than half of which goes to the foster family to cover living expenses. Still, the tradition persists, in large part because Geelians are proud of it. In a 1962 survey of Geel foster families, American psychiatrist Matthew Dumont found that their main reason for accepting boarders was custom.

183973,449,primary,411," Germany threatened on Friday to retaliate against the United States if new sanctions on Russia being proposed by the U. S. Senate end up penalizing German firms. The Senate bill, approved on Thursday by a margin of   includes new sanctions against Russia and Iran. Crucially, it foresees punitive measures against entities that provide material support to Russia in building energy export pipelines. Berlin fears that could pave the way for fines against German and European firms involved in Nord Stream 2, a project to build a pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic. Among the European companies involved in the project are German oil and gas group Wintershall, German energy trading firm Uniper, Royal Dutch Shell, Austriaâ€™s OMV and Franceâ€™s Engie. German Chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s spokesman described the Senate bill, which must be approved by the House of Representatives and signed by President Donald Trump before it becomes law, as â€a peculiar moveâ€. He said it was â€strangeâ€ that sanctions intended to punish Russia for alleged interference in the U. S. elections could also trigger penalties against European companies. â€That must not happen,â€ said the spokesman, Steffen Seibert. In an interview with Reuters, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said Berlin would have to think about   if Trump backed the plan. â€If he does, weâ€™ll have to consider what we are going to do against it,â€ Zypries said. The sharp response from Berlin comes at a time of deep strains in the transatlantic relationship due to shifts in U. S. policy and a more confrontational rhetoric towards Europe under Trump. The new U. S. president has lambasted European partners for not contributing more to NATO, slammed Germany for running a large trade surplus with the United States and broken with allies on climate change with his decision to exit the landmark Paris agreement on combating greenhouse gas emissions. Ironically, the part of the Senate bill that targets Russia was introduced by some of the presidentâ€™s top critics, including Republican hawk John McCain. They are intent on limiting Trumpâ€™s ability to forge warmer ties with Russia, a key foreign policy pledge during his campaign for the presidency, but one he has been unable to deliver on amid investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the U. S. election. DIALOGUE BREAKS DOWN Under Trumpâ€™s predecessor Barack Obama, Washington and Europe coordinated closely as they ramped up sanctions against Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraineâ€™s Crimea region. But the dialogue has broken down under Trump, who considered easing sanctions against Russia when he first came into office, according to U. S. officials. â€I regret that the joint approach of Europe and the United States on Russia and sanctions has been undermined and abandoned in this way,â€ Zypries told Reuters. France and the European Commission also urged the United States to coordinate with its partners on such matters. â€For several years, we have underlined to the United States the difficulties that extraterritorial legislation spark,â€ a French foreign ministry spokesman told reporters. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, due to start pumping gas from Russia to Europe from 2019, has been dogged by controversy. Eastern European and Baltic states fear it will make them hostage to Russian gas and undercut Ukraine by depriving it of transit fees for Russian gas supplies to Europe. Nordic nations, meanwhile, have security concerns over the pipeline running through territorial waters, where Russia has bolstered its military presence in recent months. Some EU diplomats fear the threat of new measures out of Washington may harden Germanyâ€™s defense of Nord Stream and complicate already difficult talks among EU nations over whether to seek joint talks with Russia over the pipeline. â€This is not helpful now. It tends to stir up desires to protect our territorial space,â€ one EU diplomat said. The House of Representatives is expected to debate the Senate bill in the coming weeks but it is unclear whether it will come up for a final vote before lawmakers leave Washington at the end of July for their summer recess"

When they tried to pull him over, the    led police to a nearby gas station and then exited his car. â€œThe driver then turned towards officers with one hand concealed behind his back, and told officers he hated his life,â€ the Fresno police department said in a statement. â€œAs he continued to advance towards officers, an   shooting occurred. â€ The department framed it as a â€œsuicide by cop. â€ His family insisted that could not be the case, urged federal officials to investigate and demanded that video from the body cameras worn by both officers involved be released. â€œI am outraged that the police would shoot my son and say that it is his fault,â€ Veronica Nelson, Nobleâ€™s mother, told reporters at a news conference not long after the shooting. â€œSo please join me as Iâ€™m demanding justice for Dylan. â€ Nobleâ€™s friends and family gathered for days at the gas station parking lot where he was killed  â€”   some waving Confederate flags and others chanting, â€œWhite lives matter. â€ And soon, they were angry at their inability to garner more attention.

213482,453,secondary,532,"â€”   have sparked nationwide protests: Doesnâ€™t the available data show more white Americans are being killed by police officers? Where is the outrage for them? â€œIf we have a shooting, we end up assuming that it had to be racial,â€ former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R) said Saturday during an interview with Fox News, in which he argued that national concerns about police killings of black men are overblown. â€œWhen in fact, as we know   â€¦     more white people have been shot by police officers this year than minorities,â€ he said. Huckabee is not, factually, incorrect. In 2015, The Washington Post launched a   database to track fatal police shootings, and the project continues this year. As of Sunday, 1, 502 people have been shot and killed by   police officers since Jan. 1, 2015. Of them, 732 were white, and 381 were black (and 382 were of another or unknown race). But data scientists and policing experts often note, comparing how many or how often white people are killed by police to how many or how often black people are killed by the police is statistically dubious unless you first adjust for population. According to the most recent census data, there are nearly 160 million more white people in America than there are black people. White people make up roughly 62 percent of the U. S. population but only about 49 percent of those who are killed by police officers. African Americans, however, account for 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just 13 percent of the U. S. population. As The Post noted in a new analysis published last week, that means black Americans are 2. 5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers. U. S. police officers have shot and killed the exact same number of unarmed white people as they have unarmed black people: 50 each. But because the white population is approximately five times as great as the black population, that means unarmed black Americans were five times as likely as unarmed white Americans to be shot and killed by a police officer"

Since 2011, however, when Republican state leaders toughened the restrictions on felon voting rights, just 2, 339   have had that right restored, the lowest annual numbers in nearly two decades, according to state data reviewed by Reuters. That compares with more than 155, 000 in the prior four years under reforms introduced by Governor Rick Scottâ€™s predecessor, moderate Republican governor Charlie Crist, the data shows. Crist, who was governor from 2007 to 2011, made it much easier to restore  â€™ voting rights. â€When I tried to be an effective member of the community, I saw that I was voiceless,â€ said Newton, whose expectations of getting his rights restored were dashed when the rules changed under a new administration. â€Iâ€™m 45, and I have never voted.â€ The dramatic slowdown has stoked a racially charged debate over whether political bias taints the process of restoring felon voting rights in the largest battleground state in the Nov. 8 presidential election"

191853,462,secondary,376,"â€Republicans oppose the felon vote change because they are concerned about the political implications,â€ said Darryl Paulson, a conservative Republican voting rights expert who sees wide restoration of voting rights as â€a huge political advantage for the Democratic Party.â€ Paulson says     should have the right to vote. Almost all U. S. states deny incarcerated felons the right to vote but many restore those rights after they have completed their sentences. Over the last two decades, more than 20 states have taken action to help people with criminal convictions regain their voting rights. Since July, Virginiaâ€™s governor has restored voting rights to 67, 000 felons. Florida is the largest of four remaining states that strip all former felons of voting rights, accounting for nearly half of those barred from voting nationally. Along with Virginia, the others are Kentucky and Iowa. TOUGH NEW MEASURES In March 2011, two months after he became governor, Scott reversed Cristâ€™s reforms, which had allowed many    felons to automatically get their voting rights reinstated after they had completed their sentences. Crist had also simplified the process for felons convicted of more serious crimes to regain their votes"
191853,463,secondary,36,"Scott, a millionaire former health care executive, put in place new restrictions, requiring   to wait for five to seven years before applying to regain the right to vote, serve on a jury or hold elected office. He said the new rules ensured   had proven they were unlikely to offend. Florida has disenfranchised about one in five   black voters, according to research collected by the Sentencing Project, a   advocacy group. That compares with about 8. 6 percent of the stateâ€™s   potential voters. Data on the Hispanic   population who canâ€™t vote because of the law was unavailable, although Hispanics make up 12. 5 percent of Floridaâ€™s inmates. The rates reflect racial disparities in criminal convictions. Floridaâ€™s current prison population is nearly 48 percent black, more than any other racial group, although blacks are only 17 percent of the stateâ€™s population. Ion Sancho, supervisor of elections in Leon County, which includes the capital city of Tallahassee, accused the Republican administration of repealing the felon voting reforms â€to reduce the number of African Americans who had their rights restored because those voters were perceived to be more Democratic voting and so therefore were targeted for elimination.â€ Sancho is a former Democrat who is now unaffiliated with either party. Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Republican officials who drove the 2011 policy changes, did not agree to be interviewed by Reuters or respond directly to questions on the accusations that the law is intended to influence elections. But Bondi has previously denied the policy amounts to racially motivated disenfranchisement. â€For those who may suggest that these rule changes have anything to do with race, these assertions are completely unfounded. Justice has nothing to do with race,â€ Bondi wrote in a 2011 newspaper editorial. Scottâ€™s office, in a statement to Reuters, said former felons need to â€demonstrate that they can live a life free of crime, show a willingness to request to have their rights restored and show restitution to the victims of their crimesâ€ in order to have their voting rights restored. â€FUNDAMENTALLY WRONGâ€ Democrats have seized on the issue as a civil rights concern, regardless of the political impact, said Nell Toensmann, who chairs the Democratic Party of St. Johns County, a north Florida region of about 225, 000 people dominated by Republicans. â€Yes, it does disenfranchise a lot of African Americans, but it disenfranchises a lot of white people who would be voting as Republicans as well,â€ she said. The   States of the Nation polling project shows a tight race in Florida. It estimates that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has a 48 percent chance of winning the state, compared to her Republican opponent Donald Trumpâ€™s 42 percent. Political scientists say the voting ban can sap votes from both parties, but some research suggests that Democrats pay a steeper price. An analysis of voting patterns by race and economic status found that if the ban had not existed during the 2000 presidential election, Democrats would have had enough votes to overturn Republican George W. Bushâ€™s   victory in Florida that won him the White House. â€In very close elections won by Republican candidates, felon disenfranchisement could be decisive,â€ said Christopher Uggen, a University of Minnesota professor who led the study. â€IF I DENY, ITâ€™S OVERâ€ Applying for voting rights can be difficult"

During a Sept. 21 meeting in a windowless room in the Florida Capitol building, 48 petitions to restore voting rights were on the agenda presented to the governor and three state officers in an   session punctuated by tears and emotional pleas. Some petitioners were represented by attorneys, others showed up solo or accompanied by a friend or relative. â€Clemency is an act of mercy. There is no right or guarantee,â€ Scott told them, urging applicants to accept culpability. State rules give him the deciding vote. â€If I deny, itâ€™s over,â€ he said.

Officials were impressed by her turnaround story, until Bondi noticed a discrepancy. Records showed Rahming had voted under a married name after her release. â€Just to see if I could vote,â€ she told the panel, explaining that for many years she had not realized that her rights were taken away.

Fifteen years later, the first goal arguably has been met, as Americans by almost every measure are safer today from another    attack than in 2001. Yet the struggle to defeat the global network of violent, rabidly   jihadist groups has recorded fewer successes. Indeed, the problem appears to have grown bigger.

215117,472,tertiary,77,"â€™s failure, analysts say, was in large measure the result of an extensive effort to harden U. S. defenses, from improved intelligence collection and tighter restrictions on air travel to a network of sensors to detect possible nuclear and biological threats. Rolf   a former CIA officer and Energy Department official who advised the White House on counterterrorism, remembered a â€œ    momentâ€ after   when U. S. intelligence agencies picked up hints of an   plot to obtain a nuclear device. â€œThe cavalry did arrive, and we have good people still working on it,â€ said   now a senior fellow at Harvard Universityâ€™s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. One of the unheralded successes of the  . 11 era is â€œthe fact that we havenâ€™t had a WMD attack in these 15 years,â€ he said. At the same time, jihadist groups, from  â€™s remnants to the Islamic State, continue to harbor ambitions to carry out catastrophic terrorist attacks against the West, and their numbers and resources have grown dramatically since 2001,   said. The Islamic State has attempted to manufacture crude chemical weapons, and it has sought to recruit scientists and technicians from around the world. â€œTheyâ€™re still trying,â€ he said. â€œAnd it only has to happen once to change everything that you thought. â€ Failing at   Yet, despite gains in safeguarding the U. S. homeland, efforts to counter the root causes of violent jihad largely have fallen flat. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) which was created by the    wave of intelligence reforms, mounted a series of efforts to map the radicalization paths of Islamist militants. But there are divided opinions on what came of that work. Michael Leiter, who led the NCTC from 2007 to 2011, said the research produced important insights that have helped guide U. S. counterterrorism policy, but never led to the discovery of sequences or patterns that would reliably signal an individualâ€™s intent to carry out an attack. â€œWe understand the general dynamics that cause radicalization to occur,â€ Leiter said in an interview. â€œKnowing how to identify the people who are radicalizing is hard enough, but then to actually filter through the ones who are radicalizing and identify those who are mobilizing toward violence? Itâ€™s terribly difficult to do, and we arenâ€™t particularly good at doing it. â€ Soon after President Obama took office in 2009, the new administrationâ€™s security team began looking for novel approaches to countering radicalization, but administration officials said the efforts languished amid internal turf battles. A week after his inauguration, former officials said, Obama directed his national security advisers to draft a report summarizing the governmentâ€™s efforts on countering violent extremism, identifying promising approaches. â€œThe president wanted a new strategy,â€ said a former senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in discussing the administrationâ€™s internal deliberations. The effort went nowhere, the former official said, in part because key advisers including John Brennan, Denis McDonough and Ben Rhodes could never agree on who should be in charge. There were â€œendless discussions between Brennan, Denis and Rhodes about who owns this,â€ the former official said. The administrationâ€™s focus became the escalating CIA drone campaign in Pakistan, and the halfhearted push on countering violent extremism â€œgot dropped,â€ the former official said. In 2010, the NCTC proposed issuing monthly grades  â€”   green, yellow and red  â€”   to the CIA, FBI and other agencies on their countering violent extremism programs as a way of prodding them to devote more attention and resources to the problem. The proposal predictably rankled the targeted agencies and was blocked. Five years later, in 2015, the White House convened an international summit on the issue, a belated push that coincided with the rise of the Islamic State. â€œWe simply did not put enough resources and focus on that as we should have,â€ acknowledged Michael Morell, the CIAâ€™s former deputy director who twice served as acting director during Obamaâ€™s presidency. A   lesson of the last 15 years, current and former officials say, is that the most effective   messages can only come from Muslims themselves  â€”   religious leaders and institutions as well as governments, which must address the political and social disparities that fuel extremism. But U. S. officials have been largely frustrated in their efforts to persuade Muslim allies to take more aggressive measures in their home countries. The Islamic State, widely regarded as the preeminent global jihad threat, has mastered the process of recruiting and radicalizing adherents to a far greater degree than   did, U. S. officials and terrorism experts say. And the Islamic State has shown itself to be far more willing than   to attack soft targets of limited strategic value, using recruits with little or no training and weapons that are simple but enormously effective in sowing fear and panic. Such attacks have come to define jihadist terrorism in the second decade of the 21st century. Longtime veterans of the terrorist fight say they are surprised, in retrospect, that such tactics werenâ€™t adopted sooner and that   remained fixated on replicating the scale of  . â€œWe were always surprised that they [ ] didnâ€™t get that  â€”   surprised that they did not seem to understand the fear and chaos that such attacks can create,â€ Morell said. â€œIt turns out that they had this fundamental belief that what they really wanted to have happen was a   attack  â€”   a single attack that would have led us to withdraw from the Middle East, to pull back the way the Soviets pulled back from Afghanistan.

The four countries are involved in an effort to get oil producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and elsewhere to freeze production at Januaryâ€™s highs.

Glencore had said in its statement earlier that â€discussions may or may not materialize and there is no certainty that any transaction will occur.â€  In a sign of its limited appetite to negotiate a sale to Glencore, Bunge said it was â€committed to continuing to execute its global   strategy and pursuing opportunities for driving growth and value creation.â€ Prior talks between Glencore and Bunge focused on a partnership in North America rather than the sale of Bunge, according to people familiar with the discussions, who requested anonymity to disclose them. Glencore also expressed interest in an acquisition of Bunge, however Bunge did not wish to pursue it, one of the sources added. Glencoreâ€™s interest in Bunge fueled ongoing speculation that, after a string of poor results, the worldâ€™s big grain trading houses are ripe for a wave of consolidation similar to the mergers and acquisitions in the farm chemicals and seed industries. Bunge shares were down 3. 4 percent at $78. 95 in   trading in New York on Bungeâ€™s statement. Large grain traders have struggled in recent years as a global oversupply and thin trading margins have squeezed their core commodity trading operations, including those of Bunge and rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co ( ) Cargill Inc [CARG. UL] and Louis Dreyfus Co. The companies, collectively known as the ABCDs of global grain trading, are also facing stiffer competition from players such as Chinaâ€™s COFCO Corp [CNCOF. UL] which recently scooped up Noble Agri and Nidera, and Japanâ€™s Marubeni Corp ( ) which bought U. S. grain handler Gavilon in 2012. Merger expectations have been bubbling in the sector for months as commodities prices remain stubbornly low. A series of bumper grain and soybean harvests in the United States and South America also mean there is little chance of a supply disruption that global grain traders could profit from. Bunge Chief Executive Soren Schroder said earlier this month that the sector was ripe for consolidation and that Bunge was prepared to take the lead in any dealmaking. He did not specify whether Bunge would be a buyer or a seller. If Glencore and Bunge were to form a partnership, it could transform Glencore into a major U. S. agricultural company. Glencore pursued Louis Dreyfusâ€™ grains business in recent years, but failed to strike a deal. The company bolstered its Canadian operations with a $6 billion deal for grain handler Viterra Inc [VILC. UL] in 2012, but spun off its grains business in 2015 and later divested 49 percent of Glencore Agri to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and British Columbia Investment Management Corp (bcIMC) for more than $3. 1 billion. CPPIB and bcIMC declined to comment about a possible partnership with Bunge. Ken Morrison, a veteran grain trader who writes a commodity trading newsletter, said he bought a â€meaningfulâ€ number of Bunge shares when prices dove after an earnings miss earlier this month. He sold about half of his shares on Tuesday. â€I think that the chances of a deal coming together at a value that is acceptable to Bunge is less than â€ he said"

Heâ€™ll see weakness in a vacuum. â€  Already, Moscow is clamoring for the Trump administration to return two Russian compounds in the United States that were seized by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russian meddling. And the Trump administration signaled in May that it would be open to returning the properties. Yet in the Senate, there is rare   in favor of tough sanctions against Russia. Last month  the Senate voted 97 to 2 for a bill that would put new sanctions in place for Russiaâ€™s election meddling and would constrain Trumpâ€™s ability to lift existing penalties. The White House was forced to step up its lobbying of Republicans in the House to slow the progress of a similar measure. Among the foreign policy experts who support Trumpâ€™s push for improved relations with Russia, there is growing frustration that the current political climate and Trumpâ€™s actions have made it all but impossible. â€œIt has been extraordinarily difficult for Trump, even if he had the means to do so, to do what is in the vital national interest, that is, improve relations with Russia,â€ said Jack Matlock, a former ambassador to the Soviet Union under president Ronald Reagan who favors improving relations with Russia. â€œTreating them as if they are enemies is absolutely absurd, and yet it permeates much of the attitude in Congress. â€ The Trump administration, meanwhile, has been moving on multiple fronts to soften the U.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has tried to ward off Congress from imposing more sanctions on Russia for its involvement in Ukraine, saying that getting tough now could hamper cooperation on other issues like fighting the Islamic State. Tillerson also said last month that the administration is not necessarily wedded to the Minsk agreement to end the fighting in Ukraine if something else would meet the same goals. Thatâ€™s a shift in position since March, when he told a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that the United States would not ease sanctions until Russia meets its Minsk commitments. â€œThe president asked me to begin a   process with Russia to see if we can first stabilize that relationship so it does not deteriorate further, and then can we identify areas of mutual interest where perhaps we can begin to rebuild some level of trust and some level of confidence that there are areas where we can work together,â€ Tillerson said during a visit to New Zealand in June. â€œThe president has been clear to me: â€˜Do not let whatâ€™s happening over here in the political realm prevent you from the work you need to do in this relationship. â€™â€ Despite Trumpâ€™s consistent overtures to Putin, however, U.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2016. It was Hillary Clinton in 2008, answering calls in March that year to pull out and endorse   Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois. She refused to leave the race until June. Now, itâ€™s Clinton who is far ahead in the delegate count and, as her campaign aides regularly say, nearing the point at which it would be functionally impossible for Sanders to catch her. And now itâ€™s Sanders who is making the argument that voters should have a choice  â€”   and that a narrow path to victory remains for him. â€œWhat excites me so much as I go around the country is to see the incredible energy of people who love this country but know we can do so much better,â€ Sanders said Tuesday night, when Clinton won four of five states, inching ever closer to locking up the Democratic nomination. The fifth state, Missouri, remained too close to call on Wednesday"

Her team includes veterans from both her and Obamaâ€™s 2008 campaigns. They see no advantage in pressing Sanders to drop out, and they know that she fell short eight years ago in part by focusing on state victories instead of the delegate count. The central lesson of 2008, they say, is for Clinton to keep her head down, stay the course and do the math. â€œItâ€™s the complete role reversal,â€ said Neera Tanden, a senior aide to Clinton in 2008 and a supporter and   now. â€œShe learned a really central lesson then, which is delegates matter the most. In fact, itâ€™s the only thing that matters. And she has run her campaign accordingly. â€ Clintonâ€™s team had been hoping Tuesdayâ€™s primaries in big,   states such as Florida, Illinois and Ohio would be the tipping point after which Sanders would have no real path to the nomination. In a memo to supporters Wednesday, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called her lead â€œcommanding. â€ â€œHillary Clintonâ€™s pledged delegate lead grew by more than 40 percent, to a lead of more than 300,â€ Mook wrote. Sanders is now â€œoverwhelmingly behind .â€‰.â€‰. and without a clear path to catching up,â€ he asserted.

210627,497,tertiary,801," Democratic   Hillary Clinton and her rival, Bernie Sanders, spoke about the challenges going forward after primary voters took to the polls in five states on March 15. (Sarah   Washington Post)   Clintonâ€™s own experience is part of the reason she has offered no advice on how long Sanders should remain in the race. â€œI absolutely respect Senator Sanders. He has a right to run his campaign in any way that he chooses, and Iâ€™m proud of the campaign weâ€™ve run,â€ Clinton said Tuesday. Her wrenching loss in 2008 came after a campaign sustained by intensely committed supporters  â€”   a parallel to the zeal of the Sanders throngs now. With that in mind, Clinton is careful to say that Sanders should run as long as he chooses, although she has exhorted her own supporters to turn out in force and perhaps hasten his exit. â€œI remember those days well,â€ said a senior Clinton aide who worked on the Obama campaign in 2008. â€œWe thought then, and itâ€™s the same thing we think now: The other candidate has a total right to stay in. It would be untoward, not to mention that it would alienate a lot of people, for us to encourage them to drop out. â€ Clinton knows better than most that Sanders has very little incentive to cede the nomination to her early. â€œIf we go to the end, we go to the end,â€ Clinton said in Tampa last week. â€œJust as I did in 2008. â€ There is also the view that a sustained nominating process will make her stronger by forcing her to examine her weaknesses and hone her message. Even though Sanders is costing her money and perhaps scraping her up some, many of her advisers and uncommitted Democrats caution that, as long as the Democratic contest remains largely civil, there is no hurry to end it. â€œItâ€™s really refining both of the campaign messages, and they are talking about things that people really care about,â€ said David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. â€œI think itâ€™s good, as long as we continue to have a substantive debate about who best can carry on the legacy of the president. â€ After Clinton dominated the South Carolina primary in late February, she began pivoting to take on Trump. But after her stinging loss in Michigan last week, she campaigned hard against Sanders in the five states that voted Tuesday: Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri. For instance, the former secretary of state has moved to fortify her opposition to the pending   Partnership trade deal, a position Sanders suggests is a    shift born of political expedience. Clinton has also focused on bringing back manufacturing jobs, but she has resisted the urge to shift her campaignâ€™s message too much away from the strategy she intends to deploy in the race against the Republicans this summer. She has had little choice. As Clinton did in 2008, Sanders is mounting an aggressive challenge that appears to set aside the issue of delegate math. In recent days, he has bored in on Clintonâ€™s record on trade issues, a vulnerability in economic Rust Belt states including Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. Tommy Vietor, who worked for Obama in 2008 and backs Clinton now, said the long slog through the spring made Obama a better candidate and will do the same for Clinton this year. The longer exposure to Sanders, and what Vietor described as his â€œcompletely unrealisticâ€ agenda, may also give some voters time to reassess  â€”   even though he and other Clinton supporters acknowledge that her message of preparation and practicality can sound dull by comparison. â€œI think the key is she has done a very good job, especially lately, of pushing back but not getting to the point where you turn off his supporters,â€ Vietor said. The senior Clinton aide, who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity, said those supporters, many of them young, idealistic and new to the political process, should have the chance to vote for the candidate who energizes them. Clinton is counting on the fact that most such supporters, given the chance to dance with the one that brung ya in their stateâ€™s primaries, would then support her in November. â€œA narrow path is a very different thing than no pathâ€ to the Democratic nomination, the Clinton aide said. It bears remembering, he added, that Clinton won a big victory in Pennsylvania in late April 2008, temporarily setting Obama back on his heels. Still, Mook, Clintonâ€™s campaign manager, responded to Clintonâ€™s setback in Michigan by simultaneously congratulating Sanders and saying that the victory would be meaningless in the end. Sanders would have to win so many contests in such an improbably â€œlopsidedâ€ fashion from here on out now that the die is cast, Mook told reporters the morning after Clintonâ€™s loss in Michigan. While Clinton is strategically racking up the delegates who ultimately determine the winner, Sanders is focused on winning a few selected states, Mook said. That argument is even stronger this week, when Clinton appears poised to register a sweep of all five states contested Tuesday. â€œYou have to set a   strategy,â€ said Robert Wolf, a former chairman of UBS who was an economic adviser for Obama in 2008 and now advises Clinton. â€œI think that whether you like it or not, you canâ€™t change what your vision is for each and every state. â€œFor the presidentâ€™s campaign in 2008 and now the secretary, when youâ€™re running a   primary, it is the way you have the best opportunity to win and then run in the general. You have to look at the issues that have the largest themes and have the largest impact. â€ Privately, Clinton backers concede that â€œthe math is on my sideâ€ is not a very compelling message when compared with Sandersâ€™s call to the ramparts for economic justice. But theyâ€™ll take it, and many are not surprised to find themselves here. â€œNothing is ever easy with the Clintons,â€ said one senior Democrat with long ties to Clinton and her husband who spoke on a similar condition of anonymity. â€œSheâ€™s going to grind it out. Itâ€™s like crawling through glass with them. Sheâ€™ll get to the promised land, but itâ€™s going to be a slog. â€  "
213283,498,tertiary,602,"  RALEIGH, N. C"
213283,499,secondary,242,"â€”   Politically turbulent North Carolina, where Barack Obama won in 2008 and then Republicans rose up to engineer a conservative revolution, has suddenly emerged as a focal point in the presidential race. The battle lines will be clear Tuesday in dueling rallies in the stateâ€™s two major cities. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will appear in Charlotte alongside President Obama, who is making his debut on the campaign trail and will try to reenergize his multiethnic coalition. That night, presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump will take the stage in Raleigh, where he is expected to lambast Clinton and present her as seeking a third Obama term. The two campaigns are angling to motivate their core supporters but also to sway a large pool of newly transplanted centrist voters such as Eric and Tonya Mills, both 46, who met here in college and moved back in 2013. â€œThereâ€™s just something that seems shady to meâ€ about Clinton, said Eric Mills, a patent lawyer, as the couple strode through a â€œFirst Fridayâ€ street party last week in Raleigh. Still, he said, he did not think he could bring himself to vote for Trump, whose political rise has been a curiosity among those Mills has met on recent business trips overseas. Tonya Mills, a civil engineer, called her vote a â€œâ€ saying that if she had to vote today, she would opt for Clinton, â€œbut it wouldnâ€™t be with my heart behind it. â€ North Carolina, with 15   votes, represents a handful of potentially decisive states that both parties see as winnable this year. While Trump has courted   whites in old industrial states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio to try to win back places that twice went for Obama, Clinton is seeking to benefit from shifting political winds in North Carolina to help her take back a state that went for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and has historically been favorable turf for the GOP. Clintonâ€™s campaign is banking on a backlash against the controversial law that limits LGBT protections, known as House Bill 2, and   trends working in favor of Democrats: an ongoing influx of   professionals along the urban and suburban corridor that stretches from here to Charlotte, and an uptick in the African American share of the electorate that is part of the legacy of Obamaâ€™s elections. Both of those demographics favor Clinton, while Trump appears strongest in the more rural areas of the state, where tobacco, textiles and   once defined its character but have since declined in the wake of the   agreements that Trump has criticized. Tuesdayâ€™s rally in Charlotte will be Clintonâ€™s second   event in the state in as many weeks  â€”   she previously gave an economic speech here, in the capital  â€”   and the campaign is making the kind of investment in staff and television advertising afforded to only seven other battleground states. The campaign says it also will have opened six offices across North Carolina within two weeks. Trumpâ€™s Tuesday rally here comes three weeks after an appearance in Greensboro. But he has only a skeletal staff presence and has yet to take to the airwaves, much to the bewilderment of some fellow Republicans. â€œHeâ€™s got some real problems to deal with, and I donâ€™t know that I have solutions,â€ said Carter Wrenn, a longtime GOP strategist who once helped run the political operation of Sen. Jesse Helms ( . C.) who died in 2008. Wrenn said Clinton is smart to be targeting a state where Republicans still have doubts about Trump and where suburban independents are trending toward Clinton. Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the state Republican Party, acknowledged that North Carolina is likely to be â€œa competitive,   state for the foreseeable future. â€ But he argued that Trump should have the upper hand. For one thing, Woodhouse said, Clinton is not as popular in North Carolina as Obama was, and Obama lost in 2012 even though Charlotte was the site of the Democratic National Convention. In a statement, Trump predicted he would â€œdo greatâ€ in North Carolina. â€œPeople of North Carolina want strength, protection and jobs, and President Obama and Hillary Clinton have let them down for many years,â€ Trump said. â€œI will bring jobs back to North Carolina, and our country, like never seen before. â€ There has been limited independent polling in the state, but whatâ€™s available suggests a competitive contest. One survey released last week by the conservative Civitas Institute put Clinton at 42 percent and Trump at 40 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 6 percent. A poll last week by the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research found a wider margin, with Clinton leading Trump, 48 percent to 38 percent, and Johnson at 8 percent. â€œThe Clinton campaign is clearly looking to expand the map,â€ said Scott Falmlen, a former executive director of the North Carolina Democratic Party. And it should, he added. â€œWeâ€™re a purple state. With the influx of the new population and the growing urbanization, itâ€™s becoming more Democratic,â€ he said. Part of Obamaâ€™s aim in North Carolina, aides say, will be to bolster Clintonâ€™s standing among   voters and African Americans, as well as among younger voters, who were part of his winning coalition but sided in large numbers during the primaries with Clintonâ€™s rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. There was a notable lack of enthusiasm for either candidate last week as hundreds of people gathered for the monthly First Friday celebration, where musicians played on the streets and restaurant patrons spilled onto the sidewalks. Sydney Sumner, 51, arrived in the area nearly a decade ago from California. A single mother, she said she was worried about Latino gang violence. â€œComing from California, I really believed in a secure border,â€ she said. On that count, she credits Trump with touching on an important issue  â€”   although Sumner said she does not think his solutions are realistic. And she has other issues with Trump. â€œYou canâ€™t have temper tantrums and be a world leader,â€ said Sumner, who works in accounting for an automotive   parts business. Sumner grew up as a Republican and was registered as one until Friday night, when she switched to independent. At First Friday, there were several people milling about with clipboards full of   forms  â€”   many of them at the direction of the Clinton campaign. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of young people here,â€ explained Joan Cater, 77, a retired nurse and one of those working with the campaign. â€œTheyâ€™re transient, and they move. They donâ€™t realize that they have to   to vote. â€ Voter registration is a key part of Clintonâ€™s strategy in North Carolina, particularly because of the goal of courting new arrivals, including professionals working in banking, biomedical, technology and other fields. The number of   adults age 25 and older in North Carolinaâ€™s metropolitan regions increased by nearly 656, 000 between 2000 and 2014, according to the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That accounted for more than half of the   growth in those regions during the period. To win in North Carolina, Clinton will also probably need an   turnout from African American voters  â€”   a group that views Trump highly unfavorably. According to exit polls, African Americans accounted for about 18 percent of the electorate in 1996. By 2012, the black share of the vote rose to 23 percent. That was partly due to population growth. But an aggressive effort by the Obama campaign to register new voters and make sure they turned out was also a big factor. â€œIt was a testament to the effectiveness of the Obama machine,â€ said Brad Crone, a   Democratic consultant. Whether Clinton can replicate that is â€œa big question mark,â€ he said. Another wild card is whether a backlash against the   HB 2 will make North Carolina voters more inclined to vote for Democrats. HB 2 drew national attention earlier this year for forcing people to use only the bathroom that matches the gender on their birth certificate. It also drew fire for blocking local gay rights protections. In response, businesses have canceled plans to open new offices in the state, conventions have been lost, and entertainers have canceled shows. The controversy was still fresh last week. Under threat of losing the National Basketball Association   Game in Charlotte next year, the North Carolina legislature considered changes to the law, but on Friday wound up only amending a provision related to bringing   lawsuits  â€”   a move that the NBA said did not go far enough. Clinton has spoken out against HB 2. Trump initially said it was unnecessary. He later clarified his position, saying this was a matter for states to decide. Whether the issue moves votes in the presidential race remains to be seen. Dave Phillips, an   manager who moved to Raleigh five years ago, said he considers the law â€œa joke,â€ but he said it does not rate high in his deliberations in a presidential race in which â€œneither of the two candidates seem like great choices. â€ Phillips, 33, a registered independent, said that he is leaning toward Clinton, in part because Trump, in his view, â€œis just a sleazeball. â€  Juliet Eilperin in Washington contributed to this report"

173368,501,tertiary,67,"The beverage giant PepsiCo has announced a plan to cut the sugar content and calories of drinks it sells around the globe. In a plan released today, Pepsi says that by the year 2025 at least   of the drinks in its global beverage portfolio are expected to contain 100 calories or fewer from added sugar per   serving. Currently a   can of Pepsi has 150 calories, all of which come from sugar. There will also be â€increased focus on zero and   productsâ€ according to the companyâ€™s statement. â€I think Pepsiâ€™s announcement is a very meaningful commitment,â€ Dr. William Dietz, a preventive health expert at George Washington University, told us. PepsiCo says its goals are â€informed by the latest dietary guidelines of the World Health Organization and other authorities.â€ These guidelines recommend that people limit sugar consumption to less than 10 percent of their daily calories. â€We know that sugar intake is an important contributor to obesity, and . .. soft drinks and soda and juices are a major source of sugar calories,â€ Dietz told us. And  â€”   as weâ€™ve reported  â€”   thereâ€™s now ample evidence that excessive sugar is linked to obesity and an increased risk of heart disease. The announcement comes as big soda companies are under increasing pressure. â€The kind of pressure weâ€™re seeing . .. to tax sugary drinks . .. sends an important message,â€ Dietz says. Just last week WHO urged governments to take steps to cut consumption  â€”   by taxing sugary drinks. Some experts say this strategy has worked in Mexico, which has had a soda tax in place since 2014. Next month, voters in several cities in California  â€”   San Francisco, Oakland and Albany  â€”   and in Boulder, Colo. will vote on initiatives that would place a tax on sweetened beverages in those cities. Momentum for this approach gathered after the city of Philadelphia passed such a measure last summer. As weâ€™ve reported, the soda industry is fighting to fend off these tax initiatives. After the Philadelphia City Council voted on the tax on sweetened beverages, the American Beverage Association called the measure a â€regressive tax that unfairly singles out beverages.â€ The ABA spent more than $4. 2 million in advertising to defeat the measure in Philadelphia. The industry says it has reserved about $9. 5 million in airtime for ad buys in the San Francisco area aimed at defeating the measures there."

The Democratic nominee addressed the email issue at the start of a speech at Kent State University. It marked a departure from her standard stump speech, as Democrats are reeling from news that FBI Director James B. Comey is revisiting his probe into the potential mishandling of classified material. â€œIâ€™m sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about, and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing,â€ less than two weeks before Election Day, Clinton said. â€œThatâ€™s a good question. â€ â€œI understand. And as Iâ€™ve said, Iâ€™m not making any excusesâ€ for setting up her private email system as she did, Clinton said. â€œIâ€™ve said it was a mistake, and I regret it. â€ On Monday afternoon, the Justice Department responded to growing calls from a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress for additional information about the renewed inquiry. In a letter to lawmakers, the Justice Department said it was moving â€œas expeditiously as possibleâ€ to investigate the new emails, but it did not provide any additional information"

171884,505,tertiary,66,"Trust the Italians to meet disaster with food. While nobody is making light of Wednesdayâ€™s earthquake that struck Amatrice, a small town in the Appenine mountains about 70 miles as the crow flies from Rome, several independent efforts have sprung up to use the townâ€™s signature dish  â€”   spaghetti allâ€™ amatriciana  â€”   to help relief efforts. What is it? Mostly tomato, with a little cured pork cheek, sheepâ€™s milk cheese and a touch of hot chili  â€”   at least in its pure form. But there are many versions out there, especially in the U. S. Paolo Campana, a graphic artist and blogger, launched the idea on his Facebook page just four hours after the earthquake destroyed Amatrice. â€We need to move quickly,â€ he wrote, suggesting that everyone give one euro (about $1. 13) for each plate of pasta allâ€™amatriciana they bought and ate. Apparently independently, Foodiamo, an    website, is organizing a fundraising campaign with several Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. And Maialino restaurant in New York and many others have decided to use pasta  â€”   not just allâ€™ amatriciana  â€”   to gather donations. In Italy, too, the idea is feeding peopleâ€™s desire to help. In just two days, Campana said on Facebook, more than 700 restaurants had agreed to raise money this way. The town of Assisi, about 46 miles northwest of Amatrice, quickly announced it would join Campanaâ€™s campaign. Restaurants there are adding the dish to their menu and will give one euro (some reports say two) per portion served. The move is partially in solidarity for the help that Assisi received after its own earthquake disaster of 1997, Assisiâ€™s mayor, Stefania Proietti, explained in a video posted on Facebook in which she is seen eating a lunchtime bowl of pasta allâ€™ amatriciana. The Italian Red Cross is coordinating relief efforts, with a clever image that plays on the ama  â€”   meaning love  â€”   in amatriciana. The Red Cross suggests a donation of two euros, one for the victims of the earthquake, and one for the Red Cross itself. Before the quake struck, Amatrice was set to host the 50th anniversary of a festival, or sagra, celebrating pasta allâ€™ amatriciana this weekend. Relief efforts focused on the dish have united pasta lovers and temporarily diverted attention from the controversy surrounding both the recipe and its association with Amatrice. And enthusiasts on social media are trying to organize a virtual sagra, planning to share images online and donate to help quake victims. The canonical version contains just four ingredients, aside from pasta: tomatoes  â€”   ideally canned or jarred, guanciale (salted, cured pork cheek) pecorino sheepâ€™s milk cheese, and some flakes of peperoncini, dried hot chilli. The pasta, some will tell you, must be bucatini, long like spaghetti but fatter, and with a hole down the center. Others say spaghetti is best, but you can also find amatriciana hiding in large, ridged tubes of rigatoni. In Amatrice, however, the sauce is served with spaghetti. Last year, in a huge public spat with an Italian television chef, the mayor of Amatrice insisted that the sauce also contained not only white wine but also both peperoncini and black pepper. That formulation was quickly denounced by top chefs in Rome. In Rome, onion can put in an appearance, as can white wine, black pepper and even olive oil. The guanciale can be soft and unctuous or crispy as crackling. Elsewhere, it seems, thereâ€™s no limit to what some chefs will put in the dish and still retain its name. As for the link with Amatrice, that, too, is contested. A â€whiteâ€ version, known as gricia and containing only guanciale and pecorino, has been associated with the mountain shepherds of the area for centuries. But tomatoes, probably canned because they donâ€™t grow well around Amatrice, were a late addition, possibly as recently as after the Second World War. And they might first have been added in Rome rather than in Amatrice. Heated discussions about the â€authenticâ€ recipe and history of any specialty are an inescapable ingredient of Italian cooking. What nobody is arguing about today is that spaghetti allâ€™ amatriciana is both delicious and good way to raise funds for the rescue and reconstruction.

160769,506,secondary,21,"  Donald Trump has selected former Indiana Sen. Dan Coats to be director of national intelligence, according to a statement from   Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team. In choosing Coats, he is getting a veteran Washington establishment figure  â€”   a senator, former lobbyist and ambassador to Germany  â€”   with a rare distinction: being banned from Russia. Coatsâ€™ views on Russia after its annexation of Crimea, and his calls for stronger sanctions as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, landed him and other senators on Russiaâ€™s banned list. Itâ€™s a major difference with the   who has praised Putin and cast doubt on U. S. intelligence conclusions that the Russian government, sought to help   Donald Trumpâ€™s election chances. Coats even mocked Russia with a David   top 10 list on Twitter in 2014: Coats served as senator from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to this year. (He did not seek   in November.) In between Senate stints, Coats served as U. S. ambassador to Germany during the George W. Bush administration and worked as a lobbyist. He was also asked by Bush to help his unsuccessful attempt to win Senate confirmation of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. Coats has been an outspoken critic of the Russian leader. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Coats wrote President Obama after Russia annexed Crimea in 2013, urging Obama to impose sanctions against a Russian weapons exporter. The senators argued the sanctions â€would send a powerful message to Putin,â€ whose foreign policy, they went on, has become â€increasingly belligerent.â€ Coats also sponsored an amendment to a Ukrainian aid bill in the Senate that would prohibit the U. S. government from doing any business with the exporter, a company called Rosoboronexport. Such actions, Coats said, â€would require our foreign partners to make a choice between America and Putin.â€ In 2014, Coats also called on organizers of soccerâ€™s World Cup to move the tournament, scheduled for Russia in 2018, somewhere else. All of which won Coats the honor of being banned from Russia, along with five other lawmakers, including Armed Services Chairman and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, and three Obama administration staff members."

But inside the Donald Trump administration, there appear to be discussions that go much further. A draft memo is raising the idea of a broad crackdown on the legal employment of   workers"
196019,508,secondary,64,"   Jeff Sessions, Trumpâ€™s nominee to serve as attorney general and guru on immigration policy, and senior adviser Steve Bannon have both been longtime restrictionists across all categories of migration, so this isnâ€™t entirely surprising. And the possible moves being circulated in a draft memo reported by the Washington Post and published last week by Vox arenâ€™t that extreme, for the simple reason that without an act of Congress there isnâ€™t that much Trump can do to alter the legal immigration system. But Trump does have some discretion in this area, and he could use it to broadly crack down on the employment of   workers in the United States"
196019,509,tertiary,61,"If Trump acts on these ideas, he is likely to encounter tension with segments of the business community, and overwhelmingly likely to harm economic growth and lower incomes for   Americans"

196019,511,secondary,346,"    One provision would shorten the span of time a foreigner is allowed to work in the United States under the Optional Practical Training rule. OPT allows a foreigner who had a student visa to work for a limited amount of time in the United States after graduation. The Obama administration expanded the OPT window from 12 months to 17 months. Two provisions deal with   visas that allow companies to hire   guest workers with technical skills. Obama acted to give the spouses of   holders permission to work, thus de facto expanding the   skilled workforce through the back door. Trump will reverse that. The order would direct agencies to â€œconsider waysâ€ to alter the way the program works to â€œensure that beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest. â€ This likely means trying to ensure that   largely go to Americaâ€™s   and highest paying tech companies, rather than, as is frequently the case today, serving to help companies that mostly do   outsourcing work. Another provision would call for a Department of Homeland Security crackdown on   visas, featuring â€œsite visits. â€   are designed to allow companies to transfer   managers to oversee   operations, but in a practical sense serve a similar role to   in generally allowing for skilled temporary workers"
196019,512,secondary,78,"Another provision targets the   Summer Work Travel Program, which largely brings foreign workers to do seasonal retail work in beach towns and other communities that see a summertime influx. Itâ€™s not clear that Trump really can do much of anything here, but the order directs the State Department to â€œimprove protections of US workers. â€  Other even vaguer provisions direct DHS to â€œimprove monitoring of foreign studentsâ€ and â€œclarify comprehensivelyâ€ that visitors on tourist visas arenâ€™t allowed to work in the United States"
196019,513,primary,183," Itâ€™s noteworthy that the draft does not target two of the largest   visa categories, neither the   visa for seasonal agricultural workers or the   visa for seasonal nonagricultural workers.

196019,514,secondary,53,"   This is bad news for the economy Immigration is a   political issue, so itâ€™s easy to get the impression that economic research is sharply divided over the impact of immigration as well"
196019,515,tertiary,219,"This is fairly misleading. As David Bier pointed out in a 2015 paper for the Niskanen Center, â€œa healthy debate exists over the effect of   immigration on   native workers, but the effects of immigration overall are positive, even according to estimates from economists who are most critical of   migration. â€ Thus, even Harvard economist George Borjas  â€”   a strong critic of immigration and    the economist most likely to be cited by immigration restrictionists  â€”   finds that immigration of unskilled workers has a small positive impact on the income of the average American worker"
196019,516,secondary,226,"   Programs targeting skilled workers, like the ones identified in the memo, are even more clearly beneficial. Proponents of programs like   claim virtually magic properties for them. Skeptics argue, plausibly, that this is overhyped. But their counterarguments involve arguing, as Ross Eikenberry does at the Economic Policy Institute, that â€œ  visas do not create jobs or improve conditions for US workers. â€ This criticism, based on careful, methodologically rigorous,   analysis, shows that while companies that win   lottery slots do hire more people, thatâ€™s because â€œnew   substantially and statistically significantly crowd out median employment of other workers. â€  If you believe this study, however, youâ€™re still left with the fact that   donâ€™t reduce the employment of   technology workers. But they do increase government tax revenue and raise the demand for skilled and unskilled labor in the larger community"
196019,517,tertiary,173,"If he signs the memo, the overall scale of the Trump impact on legal work visa issuance is difficult to ascertain at this point. The order is vague in a number of ways, and, as weâ€™ve learned over the past 10 days, the Trump administration is often open to interpreting and then reinterpreting its own orders after theyâ€™ve been issued.

He said there were no civilian casualties. The   attack came as officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and China have been pressing for a resumption of the peace process, interrupted last year, between the   government in Kabul and the Taliban. But it remains unclear whether the Taliban, struggling to contain deep internal divisions, will take part in direct peace talks that the   group hope will be held in Islamabad as early as next week. In a statement issued after the attack in Kunar, President Ashraf Ghani said his government would not conduct peace talks with groups that killed innocent people and said security forces would step up the fight against terrorism. The Taliban, fighting to restore hardline Islamist rule in Afghanistan, has conducted a series of attacks in Kabul and other areas this year and has pressed its military campaign in the southern province of Helmand, where it has forced government troops to pull out of a number of districts. Earlier on Saturday, a suicide bomber killed a local militia commander and at least 12 others outside the governorâ€™s compound in Asadabad, the provincial capital of Kunar, near the border with Pakistan. Provincial Governor Wahidullah Kalimzai said the bomber rode up on a motorcycle to the entrance of the compound and blew himself up, wounding at least 40 people. â€Most of the victims were civilians and children who were either passing by or playing in the park,â€ he said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the apparent target of the attack, a tribal elder and militia commander named Haji Khan Jan, was among the dead.

WASHINGTON A    American soldier has died in Afghanistanâ€™s Helmand Province from wounds received in an attack, the Pentagon said on Wednesday. "
167479,522,tertiary,375,"The Pentagon has opened all jobs across the military to women, including   posts in the infantry and special operations forces. The announcement in December came after a nearly   process, and with the acknowledgement that women had fought and died in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Issue, That historic change has raised another historic question: Are women now facing the draft? The Short Answer, No. Congress would need to change the law that governs Selective Service in order to require women to register, and that hasnâ€™t happened. Congress would also need to pass a law to restore the draft itself  â€”   a long shot, considering how unpopular it is. The debate is largely about symbolism and principle. The Long Answer, President Barack Obama has removed all past restrictions on military service, including by gay, lesbian and transgender troops who want to serve openly and women who qualify to join   combat units. The Pentagonâ€™s admission of women to the infantry and other units sparked a debate in Washington over whether that meant women must also register to be drafted along with young men  â€”   and whether they might be called up involuntarily. Obamaâ€™s administration has not taken a position, citing the need to study the issue and at least two ongoing lawsuits in the federal court system. Those suits, by plaintiffs who challenged the ban on drafting women, could someday result in a ruling that might change Selective Service. The Supreme Court upheld the ban on registering women in 1981, citing the ban then in place on women in combat. With women now admitted, the court might opt to hear the new cases and it could issue a new ruling. For now, at least two top military commanders  â€”   Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller  â€”   have said they personally support registering and potentially drafting women. The debate in Washington spread to the 2016 presidential race. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, has said sheâ€™d need more information about a proposal to evaluate it. Her Democratic challenger, Bernie Sanders, so far hasnâ€™t volunteered a position, nor has Republican candidate Donald Trump. Florida Sen. Marco Rubioâ€™s view is nuanced. He supports requiring women to register with the Selective Service, but not drafting them into combat roles. â€The U. S. military is not an instrument for social experimentation,â€ his campaign website says. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, however, has been clear that he opposes registering and drafting women. He has used the issue to try to underscore his conservatism. â€We have had enough with political correctness, especially in the military,â€ he said during a New Hampshire town hall. â€Political correctness is dangerous. And the idea that we would draft our daughters to forcibly bring them into the military and put them in close combat, I think is wrong. It is immoral, and if I am president, we ainâ€™t doing it.â€ The U. S. hasnâ€™t drafted anyone since 1973. Although young men still must register when they turn 18, it would require an act of Congress to revive selective service, include women, or both. That means the current debate over the draft is mostly symbolic and highly political. Some advocates tie drafting women to larger issues of fairness in the United States, such as the 1970s debate over the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution. Since the Pentagon lifted its ban on women in combat, at least two members of Congress have sponsored a bill that would require women to register when they turn 18. Lawmakers may hold hearings about the issue, but few members of Congress have shown no eagerness to tackle the issue, anxious about difficult symbolic votes on an unpopular issue in an election year.

But Kumail, like many a disaffected member of his generation, has soured on the concept of religion. So when he takes his rug into the basement, he sets his iPhone timer and watches exactly five minutes of YouTube videos. This scene is gold. But it comes with the little stinger that Kumail knows he can only tell this particular joke to himself. His parents made sacrifices for him, built new lives in an unfamiliar country for him, and all they asked in return was that he continue to practice Islam  â€”   the one thing he no longer wants to do, because America has changed his priorities. That extends to their hopes for his arranged marriage, or, as Kumail notes they call it at home, a marriage. â€Who could that be?â€ his mother asks when the doorbell rings, returning every time with a pretty, single Pakistani woman the bachelorettes leave behind their headshots, which Kumail chucks into a shoebox.

165842,525,secondary,715," blend of sprawling,   comedy and tearjerker melodrama that he worships but hasnâ€™t quite been able to pull off since The    Virgin. Because, yes, this movie about comedians has a side of tears. But not right away, you gluttons for sadness. Opposite Nanjiani, who plays himself, there is the effortlessly charming Zoe Kazan as Emily, a white graduate student who flirts with him at his show before insisting that she canâ€™t see anyone right now. She insists this as one beer turns into three dates and various nights on his apartmentâ€™s air mattress. Thereâ€™s a nice joke where Emily tries to set limits by calling an Uber from Kumailâ€™s place, and his phone buzzes because he moonlights as a driver  â€”   destiny by way of the App Store. Kumail wants badly to be with Emily, but canâ€™t bring himself to tell his parents (Anupam Kher and Zenobia Shroff) for fear they will disown him he tries confiding in his brother (Adeel Akhtar) who advises him to break off the relationship immediately so he wonâ€™t upset the family. His loyalty to his parents leads him to attempt a double life, and soon a hurt Emily has called off their relationship. The complexity of Kumailâ€™s feelings toward his heritage is refreshing. He clearly loves his culture, and has written a   show about Pakistan, including an oral exam, which he makes his friends suffer through. Yet thereâ€™s a sense that heâ€™s become trapped by his family, even beyond the familiar    jokes where they hint at preferred careers in medicine or law. Theyâ€™re barreling toward something that is going to hurt. And thatâ€™s all before the Big Sick rears its ugly head. After breaking up with Kumail, Emily collapses and is placed in intensive care at a local hospital, where, in a medically induced coma, she canâ€™t see that her   is doting over her. The film doesnâ€™t get too lost in medical jargon, but the real Gordon has a rare autoimmune disorder called   Stillâ€™s disease (AOSD) a form of arthritis that can (and does) shut down major organs in the body. Movie characters spend more time lounging around hospitals than pharmacy reps, but The Big Sick is the first â€hospital filmâ€ in a while that makes us feel the stakes of a vicious mystery disease in our guts. While Emily suffers rounds of tests, her parents come to town, and theyâ€™re played in a brilliant bit of casting by Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. Hunterâ€™s   nurturing instincts and Romanoâ€™s   blunderings give Kumail a different window into parenting from his own though at first wary of him because they know heâ€™s been dishonest with their daughter, they soon warm to his sheepish charms and form an unlikely trio facing down this anxiety together. Though The Big Sick is not especially concerned with making you laugh, it does have a lot to say about laughter: in an electrifying scene, the parents go to Kumailâ€™s comedy show to take their mind off things, and wind up defending him from a racist heckler. Their anger is, at least in part, because their right to laugh at something has been violated. Nanjianiâ€™s biggest strength as a comedian is also his biggest weakness as a dramatic actor: the withering line deliveries that sound like heâ€™s struggling to control his sarcasm. His chemistry with Kazan helps us take him more seriously, though the demands of the story are such that they arenâ€™t together for long before Emily goes comatose. In the filmâ€™s second half, the laws of attraction are really being applied to Kumailâ€™s relationship with Emilyâ€™s parents, who grow to appreciate him without her knowledge, and without Kazanâ€™s infectious onscreen presence. So maybe this isnâ€™t really a  . But buried inside this seeming flaw is the filmâ€™s unique, understated comic irony. After rejecting his parentsâ€™ attempts to arrange his marriage, Kumail winds up arranging his own."

192436,532,tertiary,495,"Clinton wrapped up her day of campaigning with a nighttime concert in Cleveland headlined by rapper Jay Z. He was joined by rappers Big Sean, Chance the Rapper, and J. Cole, and by his wife, popular singer Beyonce, as a surprise guest. â€We have unfinished work to do, more barriers to break, and with your help, a glass ceiling to crack once and for all,â€ Clinton said at the concert"
192436,533,primary,225," At his final rally of the day in Pennsylvania, Trump mocked  Clinton for her celebrity supporters. â€I am here all by myself. Just me, no guitar, no piano, no nothing,â€ he said. Earlier in the day at a rally in Pittsburgh, Clinton cited the governmentâ€™s latest jobs report as evidence of the economyâ€™s strength. The report showed higher wages for workers as well as the creation of 161, 000 jobs in October and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4. 9 percent from 5 percent. â€I believe our economy is poised to really take off and thrive,â€ Clinton told the gathering, after being introduced by billionaire investor Mark Cuban. â€When the middle class thrives, America thrives.â€ Trump disputed Clintonâ€™s rosy view, telling a crowd in New Hampshire that the jobs report was â€an absolute disasterâ€ and was skewed by the large number of people who have stopped looking for jobs and are no longer in the labor market. â€Nobody believes the numbers anyway. The numbers they put out are phony,â€ he said, referring to the figures released by the U. S. Labor Department. The economy and the candidatesâ€™ competing visions for the future could be critical in swaying voters in ailing Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Both candidates made stops in Ohio and Pennsylvania on Friday, with Trump adding a stop in New Hampshire and Clinton adding one in Michigan. Each of those states is key in the    quest for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. TIGHTENING POLLS The race has tightened significantly in the past week, as several swing states that are considered   for Trump shifted from favoring Clinton to   according to the   States of the Nation project. The two candidates are now tied in Florida and North Carolina, and Clintonâ€™s lead in Michigan has narrowed so much that the state is too close to call. Ohio remains a dead heat, and Clinton has a slight lead in Pennsylvania. Clinton is still the favorite to win Tuesdayâ€™s election, with a clearer path to winning of the Electoral College. But Trump now has a plausible route to victory, especially if there is a sharp fall in turnout among   from the levels of the 2012 election. Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV star, has made a pitch for   workers who have been angered by   deals and feel abandoned by Washington. But his protectionist rhetoric   he has promised to review trade agreements   appears to be having mixed success in the Rust Belt"
192436,534,tertiary,757," polling from   found a majority in both Ohio and Pennsylvania believe that international trade benefits Americans by keeping the cost of goods low, although they also think it hurts â€average Americansâ€ by depressing wages and causing job losses at home. Clinton appears to be leading among labor union households in both states, the poll found. She has a   lead with women in both, while Trump has a more modest lead with men. Among whites, Trump has a   lead over Clinton in Ohio and a   lead over Clinton in Pennsylvania. In the final stretch, the two candidates continued to paint a dire scenario of life in the United States if their opponent captures the White House. Trump said the FBIâ€™s fresh examination of emails that may be related to Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server for government work while she was secretary of state could lead to â€a constitutional crisis.â€ â€Arenâ€™t we tired of all this stuff?â€ he asked. â€America deserves a government that can go to work on Day One.â€     PUSH Clinton suggested the volatile Trump, who has feuded with and insulted a wide array of people and groups including Muslims, Mexican immigrants and women, was too unpredictable to trust. â€Think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who insults him,â€ she said.

197169,539,primary,528,"Nowadays data scientists at Crisis Text Line are using machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to pull out the words and emojis that signal a person at higher risk of suicide ideation or  . The computer tells them who on hold needs to jump to the front of the line to be rescued"
197169,540,primary,293,"They can do this because Crisis Text Line does something radical for a crisis counseling service: It collects a massive amount of data on the 30 million texts it has exchanged with users. While Netflix and Amazon are collecting data on tastes and shopping habits, the Crisis Text Line is collecting data on despair"
197169,541,secondary,608,"   â€œHow can we spot these events before they occur? Seeing the actual language that people use is going to be critical to [answer] that. â€ The data  â€”   some of which is available here  â€”   has turned up all kinds of interesting insight.

197169,542,tertiary,812,"   CTL started in 2013 to serve people who may be uncomfortable talking about their problems aloud or who are just more likely to text than call. Anyone in the United States can text the number â€œ741741â€ and be connected with a crisis counselor. â€œWe have around 10 active rescues per day, where we actually send out emergency services to intervene in an active suicide attempt,â€ says Bob Filbin, the chief data scientist at CTL. Sending help to people in crisis is just the start. The hotline hopes its data could one day actually help predict and prevent instances of   from happening in the first place. Recently I talked to Filbin about what data science and artificial intelligence can learn about how to help people. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity"
197169,543,secondary,177,          Brian Resnick   Tell me about the service Crisis Text Line provides
197169,544,secondary,880,"   Bob Filbin  The idea is that a person in crisis can reach out to us  â€”   no matter the issue, no matter where they are  â€”     via text and get connected to a volunteer crisis counselor who has been trained. The great thing about that is people have their phones everywhere: You can be in school, you can be at work, and whenever a crisis occurs, we want to be immediately accessible at the time of crisis. [Suicide attempt] is the greatest type of risk that weâ€™re trying to prevent"
197169,545,primary,659,"   Brian Resnick   Youâ€™re also collecting data on these interactions. Why is that necessary to run the service? Bob Filbin   We have 33 million messages exchanged with texters in crisis. We have had over 5, 300 active rescues [where theyâ€™ve dispatched emergency services to someone attempting suicide] and the entire message and conversations associated with those"
197169,546,primary,176, Our data gives the rich context around why a particular crisis event happened. We get both the cause and the effect. And we get how they actually talk about these issues. I think itâ€™s going to provide a lot more context on how can we actually spot these events and prevent them. How can we spot these events before they occur? Seeing the actual language that people use is going to be critical to [answer] that
197169,547,tertiary,707,"From the very beginning, we believed in the idea that our data could help to improve the crisis space as a whole. By collecting this data and then sharing it with the public, with policymakers, with academic researchers . .. it could provide value to people in crisis whether or not they actually used our service"
197169,548,tertiary,641,"          Brian Resnick   So, someone in crisis texts your service. Iâ€™m curious about the specific data youâ€™re collecting from that interaction"
197169,549,secondary,429,"  Bob Filbin   There are three types of data weâ€™re collecting:  The conversation  â€”   the exchange between a texter and a crisis counselor, and then a lot of metadata around those conversations (timestamps; the people who were involved: the crisis counselor, the texter). If the texter comes back, we know, okay this is a texter that has used our service before, or this crisis counselor has had other [interactions with the texter]"
197169,550,secondary,74,"Second: After the conversation, we ask our crisis counselors [questions like] â€œWhat issues came up in the conversation?â€ and, â€What was the level of risk?â€ The third piece: a set of survey questions to the texter asking for feedback: â€Was this conversation helpful?â€ â€œWhat type of help did you experience?â€ â€œWhat did you find valuable?â€ â€What would you hope would be different for other people in crisis? Or the same. â€ Brian Resnick   So how has this data helped you do your job better? Bob Filbin   Weâ€™ve seen problems arise, and then we think about how to use data to solve these problems"
197169,551,primary,859,So one problem is spike events
197169,552,secondary,489,"A spike is when we see a huge influx in texter demand  â€”   this happens to crisis centers all the time. When Robin Williams died by suicide, around the election, around the Paris terrorist attacks in 2015, or perhaps somebody who used the service and found it beneficial, and that goes viral  â€”   weâ€™ll have a big spike event. Our daily volume will more than double"
197169,553,primary,381,"   Brian Resnick   So how do you respond to that? Bob Filbin   Traditionally crisis centers respond to people in the order in which they come into the queue. But if you double your volume instantly, thatâ€™s going to lead to long wait times. We want to help the people who have the   cases first: We want to help  somebody whoâ€™s feeling imminently suicidal before somebody whoâ€™s having trouble with their girlfriend or boyfriend or something. We trained an algorithm. We asked, â€œWhat do texters say at the very beginning of a conversation that is indicative of an active rescue?â€ So we can triage and prioritize texters who say the most severe things. Brian Resnick   When you say youâ€™re â€œaskingâ€ these questions, you mean youâ€™re using a computer? Machine learning or some type of AI?  Bob Filbin   Weâ€™re asking a computer to figure it out"
197169,554,secondary,699," [We ask it] basically, look at active rescue conversations and is there anything different about the initial messages that texters send in those"
197169,555,secondary,709,"  Brian Resnick     So what type of words did the computer pick out that indicated imminent risk?  Bob Filbin   Before we used the computer, we had a list of 50 words that [we thought] were probably indicative of high risk. Words like â€œdie,â€ â€œcut,â€ â€œsuicide,â€ â€œkill,â€ etc"
197169,556,primary,808,"When a data scientist ran the analysis, he found thousands of words and phrases indicative of an active rescue that are actually more predictive. Words like â€œIbuprofenâ€ and â€œAdvilâ€ and other associated words [i. e. common household drugs] were 14 times as indicative of suicide as a predictor"
197169,557,tertiary,25,Brian Resnick   Wow. Bob Filbin   Even the crying face emoticon  â€”   thatâ€™s 11 times as predictive as the word â€œsuicideâ€ that somebodyâ€™s going to need an active rescue
197169,558,primary,278,This allows us to do a task that we never otherwise would have been able to do. We just donâ€™t have staff to triage. And most [other crisis] centers donâ€™t either. So then people who are   get stuck waiting for two hours
197169,559,tertiary,228,"   Thatâ€™s the whole idea and the power, really, of AI  â€”   it gets smarter over time. We started at a baseline of â€œhereâ€™s what crisis centers do already. How can we use data to improve on that?â€ Weâ€™re never rolling out a product that decreases performance. And thatâ€™s something we always monitor"
197169,560,secondary,709,"          Brian Resnick   How do you keep all this information private?  Bob Filbin   Privacy of our texters is our No. 1 concern. One really concrete way we do that is we have this keyword that texters can text at any time  â€”   itâ€™s â€loofahâ€  â€”   which  allows you to scrub your data at any time. (Itâ€™s kind of a pun. Or a lame joke.) We want to make sure our texters are charge of the data. And we do have an algorithm we built to scrub personally identifiable information. It removes names, locations, phone numbers, emails, birth dates, or other numbers like that"
197169,561,tertiary,744,"This is all after the data is encrypted. So there are many layers of security and privacy that we go through to protect the data. Brian Resnick   A lot of therapists and people who work in the therapy space have a   aversion to data, relying instead on their experience and intuition. (The Atlantic recently had an interesting feature on this.) What do you say to people who may be skeptical of using data in crisis counseling?  Bob Filbin   So the underlining philosophy that Iâ€™m always coming back to for data science is, â€Can we provide the most possible value back to our users?â€ And the way you do that is by learning from every interaction"
197169,562,primary,5,"Thatâ€™s true about the smartest people in the world, right? You reflect on an experience, you learn from it, and you then you behave differently next time. I think data is a way to do that at scale. Weâ€™re saying, no human can understand the scope and reflect on the performance and service as a whole, so we need data to allow us to reflect and improve"
197169,563,tertiary,451,"  Weâ€™re helping people who are in imminent crisis, maybe imminently suicidal. And so we want to make sure we put any recommendations from our computer systems through the lens of a person, that a person is evaluating whether or not itâ€™s the correct decision. Brian Resnick   What do you mean by â€œput any recommendations from our computer systems through the lens of a personâ€?  Bob Filbin   One of the first major insights from our data was that we had about 3 percent of our texters using 34 percent of our crisis counselorsâ€™ time  â€”   draining a huge percentage of our crisis counselorsâ€™ resources. They were treating us, in some sense, as a replacement [for] therapy, not as a crisis service"
197169,564,primary,668,"That was a problem that was exposed in the data, but the solution wasnâ€™t intuitive. It was actually kind of a philosophical decision as an organization to say, weâ€™re here for people in crisis, we arenâ€™t replacement therapy, thatâ€™s a very   service"
197169,565,primary,94,Our goal is going to be to identify these [frequent] texters who may need [ ] therapy
197169,566,tertiary,888,"  The data really exposed that difficult question and forced us as an organization to make a philosophical stand that weâ€™re here for people in crisis. And so it does lead to, really, data and that revelation leads to difficult decisions, and that does happen. Brian Resnick   Are you scared of using data alone to make that decision to nudge people off the service? What if one of those circlers truly is in a crisis?  Bob Filbin   The first step is we put this through our supervisors. We flag a texter who appears to be circling. Then the supervisor makes the call. We always have the human making the decision. We donâ€™t block anybody, because that person could legitimately have a huge crisis. We never block people from entering the system. But we do limit or throttle access. Putting it through that human lens always is very important because we donâ€™t want to miss anything. And itâ€™s so critical that weâ€™re there for all these people. "
172524,567,tertiary,17,"Can a country have a split personality? When it comes to Colombia, thereâ€™s the    nation of gorgeous cities: Think gleaming skyscrapers, landscaped parks and smooth bike lanes all set against stunning mountains. Then thereâ€™s the other Colombia, a vast stretch of rural territory thatâ€™s desperately poor and at best, effectively lawless. At worst, many of these areas are still dominated by some combination of guerrilla forces, paramilitary groups and   gangs that have flourished over   years of civil war. â€I always have trouble explaining to people just how quickly you jump from the edge of the Colombia where thereâ€™s government into an area where the government just disappears,â€ says Adam Isacson, a senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group. â€In some cases, even just a few miles outside a major city, youâ€™ll find yourself in a place where thereâ€™s no police, no paved roads, where electricity is gotten by generator, if at all, and where almost nobody has land titles for the land theyâ€™re farming.â€ The vast gulf between Colombiaâ€™s dual identities has taken on new importance in light of a new peace deal aimed at finally ending the civil war. The agreement  â€”   which must be ratified in a referendum Oct. 2  â€”   calls for the largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, to completely disband. In exchange, the government would launch a major investment effort thatâ€™s supposed to raise the income of the rural poor  â€”   essentially, to close the gap between the two Colombias. The challenge has parallels with the one Germany faced after its West and East were reunified, says Peter Schechter, director of the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a   research institution. Except that Colombia doesnâ€™t have anywhere near the wealth West Germany was able to draw on. The United States and other donors have committed to helping out with aid. Even so, says Schechter, â€This is a huge endeavor, and itâ€™s an endeavor a developing nation simply hasnâ€™t done.â€ Still, he is optimistic that Colombia can succeed, in part because of its recent history. Back in the late 1980s, Schechter notes, the civil war and related rise in drug trafficking had produced a level of corruption, crime, kidnappings and terrorism that appeared to threaten the nationâ€™s very existence. â€This was a country on the abyss of becoming a failed state,â€ says Schechter. â€Then Colombians decided, â€™Thatâ€™s it. Weâ€™re done.â€™ And they turned it around.â€ Specifically, with the help of a military aid package from the United States dubbed â€Plan Colombiaâ€ in 1990, the government combined an intense military crackdown on guerrilla and   groups with a major effort to revamp the economy and boost incomes. This included significant spending on health, education and infrastructure in urban zones, as well as savvy management of national trade, monetary and tax and spending policies. The result: Over the next 25 years, Colombiaâ€™s cities steadily became secure again. A flood of foreign investment rushed in. And urban poverty was substantially reduced. â€What happened in Colombia is an amazing story,â€ says Schechter. â€Now with the pending peace agreement, they have the opportunity to write the next chapter.â€ â€Sure, the discipline and focus and resources required will be immense,â€ he adds. â€But listen, theyâ€™re pretty determined.â€ Other analysts look at that same history and find reasons for concern. Michael Shifter, president of the   Dialogue, a think tank in Washington, D. C . says the countryâ€™s recent progress underscores a   inclination by Colombiaâ€™s governing elites to favor urban development while ignoring the rural population. â€The differences in wealth were always there,â€ he says. â€And they just became accentuated in the 1990s when Colombia began to have a more modern economy and open up to the world.â€ Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America, says the governmentâ€™s   disregard for rural areas was palpable on a trip he took just a few a weeks ago to an area near Colombiaâ€™s border with Venezuela. The only road was built by an oil company decades ago. â€By now it has completely fallen apart,â€ he says. â€So to go about 90 miles takes more than seven hours. And this is the main thoroughfare of a region with a population of about 50, 000 people.â€ This neglect of Colombiaâ€™s rural population by successive governments has created a vicious cycle, says Shifter. Initially, it helped fuel the rise of rebel groups in rural areas during the early years of the civil war  â€”   which began in the late 1940s. Then the consequent lack of security in those parts made it difficult for the government to bring economic aid to rural populations even as it began its push to improve life in Colombiaâ€™s urban centers. â€You couldnâ€™t invest [in many rural areas] because it was too dangerous,â€ says Shifter. And this, in turn, kept those areas economically depressed, further intensifying   sentiment and violence. In theory, the peace deal could end the cycle by finally bringing security to the countryside. But thereâ€™s a possible paradox, says Isacson: The governmentâ€™s effectiveness at stamping out violence in urban Colombia could make the large share of voters there reluctant to ratify the peace deal. They are the least likely to feel the immediate benefits of the deal because for them, the war has long been over, he explains. â€They only see it on television. They donâ€™t live it in urban areas,â€ he says. And itâ€™s these same urban voters who would likely bear the costs of the agreement  â€”   including any tax hikes the government might need to impose to raise money for the aid package to rural areas. So, says Shifter, â€that is a base of people who will be really unwilling to make the concessions the peace deal will require.â€"
192392,568,secondary,607," U. S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is running again for the job in the next Congress, a spokeswoman said on Thursday after a media report quoted several unidentified House Republicans as saying they expected him to step down next week. â€He is running,â€ Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. The Hill cited four House Republicans as saying that they expected Ryan to step aside as Speaker after next Tuesdayâ€™s general election. â€Speculation is growing that Paul will not return,â€ the Hill quoted a â€senior GOP lawmaker close to leadershipâ€ as saying. It quoted a member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans, as saying that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wins, Ryan will get â€a good share of the blameâ€ among House members who support Republican candidate Donald Trump. Ryan last month told fellow Republicans that he would not defend or campaign for Trump and would instead focus on   Republicans to keep the majority in the House. This angered some Trump supporters in the House, who felt the Wisconsin congressman should stand by Trump. One of them, Representative Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma, tweeted: â€if Paul Ryan isnâ€™t for Trump, then Iâ€™m not for Paul Ryan.â€ But Ryan, who as Speaker is the countryâ€™s   Republican, has a great deal of support in the Republican caucus, and it is far from clear that his critics would be able to oust him if they tried. House Republicans, who currently number 246, plan to have   leadership elections in  . Ryan is expected to win their nomination for Speaker at that gathering, but the actual election to the Speakerâ€™s post would not be held until the new Congress convenes in January. All members of the House, both Republican and Democrat, will vote in the Speaker election and Ryan will need 218 votes   a majority of the Houseâ€™s 435 members   to win.

Instead he was being discharged with a diagnosis of headache, although doctors werenâ€™t sure of its cause. Several hours earlier, on the day after Thanksgiving 2013, Chesivoirâ€™s family had summoned an ambulance to their Montgomery County home after he became suddenly weak and unable to walk.

When an episode occurred in a grocery store parking lot, Chesivoirâ€™s first thought was that he was having a stroke. He got back in his car and examined his face in the mirror, unable to detect a facial droop that is a characteristic sign of stroke. The odd feeling passed quickly and Chesivoir, who had no underlying health problems that could predispose him to a stroke, felt reassured. Heâ€™d had similar episodes a few years earlier, but doctors had found nothing. This time his shakiness seemed more pronounced when he stood up after sitting. Chesivoir also began suffering from headaches. The doctors who reviewed his tests at the emergency room said the only thing of significance was evidence of a possible old brain bleed. Had he fallen or hit his head? Chesivoir told them that he had banged his head on the mantel putting wood in his fireplace and while roughhousing with his teenage sons  â€”   but never hard enough to see stars or lose consciousness. â€œThey didnâ€™t seem too concerned about it,â€ Chesivoir recalled. Doctors told him they suspected his head pain was caused by either migraines or cluster headaches. After conferring with his internist, Chesivoir consulted a neurologist. Looking at the images Chesivoir had brought with him from his ER visit, he recalled that she seemed concerned that something on his spine might be causing the tingling. She ordered more tests and scheduled a   appointment for Jan. 21. But over the next few weeks, Chesivoirâ€™s headaches worsened. â€œIâ€™d go to bed and wake up in the middle of the night feeling like flaming railroad spikes were thrusting into my skull,â€ he said. â€œBut at that point I wasnâ€™t too concerned, because so many tests had been done and there was nothing awful found. I figured it was some kind of headacheâ€ that could be treated with medication. On New Yearâ€™s Eve, while watching a movie at home, Chesivoir stood up, complained that his head hurt and pitched face forward onto a coffee table, briefly losing consciousness. His wife, Carole Klein, called an ambulance; by the time it arrived Chesivoir seemed to be functioning normally. He walked out of the house, met the crew in the driveway and sent them away saying he was okay. Klein, an   lawyer, had grown increasingly worried about her husband. â€œThe scariest thing was that it seemed like his personality was changing,â€ she recalls. â€œHe just wasnâ€™t right. Brad is very gregarious and outgoing. He became cautious and would look like he was on edge and afraid. â€ By Jan. 2, 2014, the headaches were worse. Chesivoir called the neurologistâ€™s office and saw a second specialist  â€”   the first was out of town  â€”   who told him that his problem was most likely an atypical migraine, which is not preceded by the aura many migraine patients describe. â€œI thought, â€˜Finally I have a diagnosis,â€™ â€ Chesivoir recalled. The neurologist prescribed amitriptyline, an antidepressant frequently used to prevent migraines. Chesivoir began taking the drug. A few days later, he telephoned the new neurologist after developing double vision in his right eye. â€œWe see this with this medication,â€ Chesivoir remembers the doctor saying. â€œCut the dose in half. â€ On Friday, Jan. 11, Chesivoir called the doctor again, minutes after his office opened. His double vision was worse and accompanied by zigzag lines; he was terrified that he was going blind. â€œI stressed to the doctorâ€™s assistant who took the call that this was very serious,â€ said Chesivoir, adding that he was assured that the doctor would call him back. Chesivoir said he never heard from the neurologist. â€˜Donâ€™t stop anywhereâ€™ On Monday morning Chesivoir called his wifeâ€™s ophthalmologist, who agreed to see him; she had an opening in her schedule that morning. Klein drove her husband to the office. Minutes after the doctor peered into Chesivoirâ€™s dilated eyes, she issued terse instructions to Klein: Drive straight to the emergency room at Washington Hospital Center, where she was on staff. Donâ€™t go home first or stop anywhere en route. Chesivoir had papilledema, a badly swollen optic nerve caused by excess pressure on his brain, and needed immediate attention. When they arrived, Chesivoir said, the ER was a zoo. (The ophthalmologist later told Chesivoir she regretted not calling an ambulance, which would have expedited his admission.) He and Klein were sent to a bay to wait for a doctor. On the other side of the curtain was a family whose members began loudly playing cellphone ring tones. â€œI lost it and started screaming at them that my head was about to explode and to please keep it down. â€ Chesivoir was admitted several hours later, after undergoing MRI and CT scans. He was told he would be meeting with Aulisi, the neurosurgeon on call. Aulisi minced no words. Chesivoir had suffered a brain bleed, an acute subdural hematoma, which had grown so large it was now the size of an adultâ€™s palm. Without brain surgery, which Aulisi planned to perform first thing the next morning, Chesivoir would probably die. Scans, including those performed on Thanksgiving weekend six weeks earlier, showed evidence of multiple bleeds, some old and some recent. Blood was pressing on brain tissue, causing his visual disturbances, weakness and searing headaches. A subdural hematoma occurs when blood pools in the space between the dura, which covers the brain, and the surface of the brain. It frequently results from a head injury that can occur during a fall; in some cases the bump is so minor patients donâ€™t remember it. In other cases there is no bump at all. Aulisi remembers one patient who developed a serious brain bleed after a violent sneeze. â€œItâ€™s a closed space, like a pressure cooker,â€ Aulisi said. A buildup of pressure in a confined space can cause the brain to herniate, or shift from its proper position, which is often fatal. â€œThey basically missed it,â€ said Aulisi of the brain bleeds, adding that diagnosis is easier in retrospect. One reason for the error, he speculated, is that a neurosurgeon did not read the original scans. A radiologist who read Chesivoirâ€™s CT scan raised the possibility of old bleeds, but other doctors did not pursue that. By the time Aulisi saw Chesivoir, there was no choice other than surgery. Klein said he told the couple that Chesivoir probably had less than 24 hours to live when he reached the ER. â€œI just sort of felt like I was waiting for the inevitable,â€ Chesivoir recalls of the night before his operation. Klein remembers feeling terrified and trying to calm their children, who were then 16 and 20. The surgery went well. In the recovery room, Chesivoir said, he â€œfelt so much better that I hadnâ€™t realized how bad I had felt. â€ Recovery was arduous and involved lying flat on his back for two days. At one point Chesivoir suddenly became confused, triggering fears that he might have suffered cognitive damage, a known complication of the surgery, or another bleed. But the confusion resolved within hours and was chalked up to postoperative swelling. â€œThat was the scariest part of the whole episode,â€ Chesivoir said. â€œI wasnâ€™t that afraid of dying, but I didnâ€™t want to be a burden on my family. â€ Several weeks after he was sent home, Chesivoir, whose hobbies include photography, was taking pictures again, his vision dramatically improved. After three months he had fully recovered. The ordeal was   he said. â€œWhen things bother me now I just have to remind myself that in the continuum of problems, this is very small. â€ Klein said that her husbandâ€™s experience has shaken her faith in doctors. In retrospect, she said, sheâ€™s not sure what else they could have done. â€œThere was nothing different to do,â€ she said. â€œWe had gone to an ER and seen two neurologists. I felt like we covered the bases. There were so many misses. â€  Submit your solved medical mystery to sandra. boodman@washpost. com. No unsolved cases, please. Read previous mysteries at wapo. "

155733,590,primary,194,"The Catholic church in England and Wales has brought the medieval manuscript Ars Moriendi  â€”   The Art of Dying  â€”   into the digital age, with a website aimed at helping terminally ill people and their loved ones deal with death. Like the original 15th century work, The Art of Dying Well is intended to bring religious comfort and offer practical guidance to people in the final stage of life. The   version offers videos, animations and interviews with terminally ill people and their carers. Although the content is based in the Catholic tradition, the church says it is intended for anyone addressing    issues. It features real stories from dying people and their families, as well as interviews with palliative care experts. In recent years there has been growing openness in society around what many see as the last taboo. Death Cafes and other events to discuss issues around the end of life have flourished, websites such as Final Fling, which offer death planning have emerged, and an increasing number of people are using the services of death doulas. Katherine Sleeman, palliative medicine registrar at the Cicely Saunders Institute in Kingâ€™s College London, said ending the silence about death would reduce fear and improve the quality of life of dying patients. She told The Art of Dying: â€œWe prepare about the arrival of a new baby, we plan for it, we think about what we are going to buy and what we are going to call the new baby. It is part of our daily life, our conversation. Why do we not prepare for our death in the same way? I would like everyone to have a good death but we canâ€™t achieve that unless we as a society stop whispering and start talking about it. â€ Another palliative care expert, Kathryn Mannix, who has witnessed some 10, 000 deaths over the course of her career, said: â€œMany people have lived to enjoy the last weeks and months of their lives. â€ Society expected terminally ill people to â€œremain miserable until they diedâ€. The original Latin texts of Ars Moriendi included advice on deathbed etiquette and prayers, and the five temptations that a dying person might face. It was illustrated with woodcuts, one of which depicted the battle between angels and demons for a dying manâ€™s soul. The modern digital version includes an animation, voiced by actor Vanessa Redgrave, featuring a fictional family preparing for a peaceful death. Redgrave has discussed wanting to die during health problems. In 2012, Bronnie Ware, an Australian palliative care nurse, wrote a book called The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, based on interviews with terminally ill people. Among the regrets was: â€œI wish Iâ€™d stayed in touch with my friendsâ€ and â€œI wish Iâ€™d let myself be happier. â€ The Art of Dying Well launches on All Saintsâ€™ Day (Tuesday)  â€”   the eve of All Soulsâ€™ Day, when Christians traditionally remember the dead. This year, the UK will mark All Soulsâ€™ Day with a mass celebrated by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, at Westminster Cathedral."

During the   debate Thursday night, Kelly landed a series of blows that seemed to leave the GOPâ€™s   reeling. The candidate and the cable news host he seems to love to hate mixed it up for a second time since August at the Republican debate in Detroit. This time, Kelly put the partyâ€™s   on the defensive with tough questioning about his failed   school, Trump University, and by airing a series of video clips in which Trump made contradictory statements about accepting Syrian refugees, the war in Afghanistan and President George W. Bushâ€™s record on the Iraq War. â€œHow is this telling like it is?â€ asked Kelly, the   at the event, after showing Trump on both sides of the issues  â€”   in one instance, as Kelly noted, in the course of a single day. It was, in some respects, almost a payback performance by Kelly, whom Trump has savaged since the first Republican debate during the summer. In that encounter, Trump objected to Kellyâ€™s opening question about his history of making disparaging comments about women. He later suggested that Kelly was biased and angry: â€œYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her  â€”   wherever,â€ he said, in a comment many interpreted as vulgar and sexist.

Instead of discussing what it means that the   lost the popular vote and probably only won the Electoral College because of interventions from Russia and the FBI, we are instead discussing the precise size of Trumpâ€™s Electoral College victory. Nicely done. The second thing Trump understands is that part of what makes politicians sound like politicians is their care for some semblance of the truth. Cautiously picking your way through a minefield of adverse facts makes you sound hedged, calculated, even dishonest  â€”   think of any answer Hillary Clinton ever gave on the   Partnership trade deal. This is related to the reaction  â€”   or    â€”   when Trump admits heâ€™s lying. Remember when he was promising to lock Clinton up? Then he got elected, and his tune changed. â€Forget it,â€ he said. â€œThat plays great before the election. Now we donâ€™t care, right?â€  This is part of Trumpâ€™s charm and his message. When other politicians lie to you, youâ€™re the one being fooled. When Trump lies to you, he makes you  â€”   or at least his supporters  â€”   feel like they were in on the joke. The lie, he suggests, was really to the media, to the establishment, to all those people trying to keep him, and you, down"

203909,620,primary,151,"           Trumpâ€™s campaign will be studied for generations. But if I had to choose his singular insight, it would be this: Attention matters. Favorable coverage doesnâ€™t. Trump said he ran for president as a businessman. In truth, he ran as what he really was, and perhaps still is: a reality television star. While politicians are taught to believe that what matters most is favorable coverage, reality television stars have learned that what matters most is the quantity of coverage  â€”   the total share of audience attention  they can command across a given season"
203909,621,tertiary,16,"The winner of the early seasons of MTVâ€™s Real World  â€”   the   show  â€”   wasnâ€™t any of the nice,   participants whose names youâ€™ve forgotten. It was the jerk whose name you remember: Puck. The winner of the first season of Survivor wasnâ€™t the cooperative, helpful contestants you might want to be trapped on an island with. It was the cynical, conniving Richard Hatch. Trump understood this, and it let him run a truly unique presidential campaign. As I wrote shortly before the New Hampshire primary:     Trumpâ€™s other gift  â€”   the one that gets less attention but is perhaps more important  â€”   is his complete lack of shame. Itâ€™s easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when theyâ€™re exposed as liars, when theyâ€™re seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested. Trump doesnâ€™t. He has the reality television starâ€™s ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others wonâ€™t, to say what others canâ€™t, to do what others wouldnâ€™t. Trump lives by the reality television trope that heâ€™s not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say theyâ€™re not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. â€Iâ€™m not here to make friendsâ€ is another way of saying, â€Iâ€™m not bound by the social conventions of normal people.â€ The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind"

He just wants you to think that. Heâ€™s running this exactly how he likes. He wants to be the joke until itâ€™s too late. â€ Trump was the joke until it was too late. He was such a joke that for months  â€”   months in which he was leading the polls  â€”   the Huffington Post would only cover him in its entertainment section. He was such a joke that his Republican challengers refused to believe him the frontrunner and focused their fire on one another, confident that Trump would collapse and they would pick up his supporters"

They made sure he led the papers, the newscasts, and the homepages, and there was no space for anyone else to be heard. The attention he got was negative, sure  â€”   but he turned that in his favor. it was Trump versus the press, Trump versus the establishment, and there were plenty of Republicans out there who wanted to see those institutions humbled"

To beat Trump, progressives will need to do as much as they can to get American politics out of reality show mode. Trump genuinely does pose threats to the integrity of American institutions and political norms. But he does so largely because his nascent administration is sustained by support from the institutional Republican Party and its standard business and interest group supporters. Alongside the wacky tweets and personal feuds, Trump is pursuing a policy agenda whose implications are overwhelmingly favorable to rich people and business owners"
203909,625,secondary,94,"His opponents need to talk about this policy agenda, and they need to develop their own alternative agenda and make the case that it will better serve the needs of average people. And to do that, they need to get out of the habit of being reflexively baited into   arguments that happen on the terrain of Trumpâ€™s choosing and serve to endlessly reinscribe the narrative of a champion of the working class surrounded by media vipers"

Polls right up to Election Day showed that the majority thought him untrustworthy, unqualified for the presidency, and temperamentally unfit to carry out its duties. But tens of millions voted for him anyway. As Yglesias writes, â€œTheir enthusiasm for Trump doesnâ€™t necessarily reflect a misperception that he is honest or that he will eschew greed and corruption. Rather, their view is that he is on their side and that the protestations of his opponents merely reflect the   defensiveness of the establishment. . .. Trump may be a sonofabitch, the thinking goes, but at least heâ€™s our sonofabitch. â€ Trumpâ€™s actual proposals were a far cry from his populist presentation and outsider promises. Trump might have run promising to turn back the special interests, but his policy papers promised a massive giveaway to Wall Street.

Joe Walsh, a Tea Party icon who backed Trump, complained on Twitter. â€œItâ€™s a cabinet full of wealthy insiders. â€ Trumpâ€™s actual proposals were obscured by the circus he created. The media was too busy covering his controversies to cover his policies.

157784,635,tertiary,688,"If Easyjet happened to run an extra flight or two out of Turkey each day, Marcus Willis would never have made it to Wimbledon, never have played on Centre Court, never have aced Roger Federer. Willis, the   tennis player in the country, squeezed into the tournament only because his friend and rival Scott Clayton decided to skip the English grasscourt season. Clayton, 22, travelled to Turkey instead to play in a Futures event at the Belconti Resort hotel in Antalya. He lost in the first round. The    had a place waiting in Wimbledonâ€™s   tournament in Roehampton. He had not planned to take it but decided he would if he could make it back to London in time to sign up. Except the registration deadline was later that night and, when he checked, the first flight didnâ€™t leave until the next morning. Willis was waiting, next in line. Happy as Clayton is for him, he still sounded just a little rueful about it. â€œMarcus was obviously the last direct acceptance into â€ Clayton says. â€œBut if I had been there that would have been me instead. â€ Clayton could not be at Wimbledon to watch Willis play on Wednesday but was there to see his win against Ricardas Berankis on Monday, his seventh successive victory in a sequence that has carried the world No772 through   qualifying, into the tournament fortnight, through the first round and on to Centre Court. â€œI saw him in the lounge after he beat Berankis,â€ Clayton says. â€œAnd he came up and said: â€˜Thanks for not playing.â€™ I will squeeze a beer out of him next time I see him, for sure. â€ Clayton says Willisâ€™s run reminds him of the Paul Bettany   Wimbledon. â€œI think maybe there needs to be a sequel, Marcus Willis, because I think it would be a great film. â€ Even Federer agreed that this all felt â€œa little bitâ€ like a movie script. â€œThis story is goldâ€šâ€œ Federer said. It seems even he was fascinated by what Willis has done. â€œI must tell you, I was quite a bit intrigued even before he was in my section of the draw,â€ Federer said. â€œAfter he qualified I was reading a lot about his story. â€ It was, Federer said, â€œdefinitely one of the matches Iâ€™ll rememberâ€ since â€œitâ€™s probably not going to happen again for me to play against a guy 770 in the worldâ€. If anything, Willis brings to mind a line from Woody Allenâ€™s tennis film, Match Point: â€œPeople are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. Itâ€™s scary to think so much is out of oneâ€™s control. â€ Scraping into qualifying wasnâ€™t even Willisâ€™s biggest break. He would already have quit the sport and started work as a coach in Philadelphia if he hadnâ€™t met his girlfriend Jennifer Bate at an Ellie Goulding gig. Of course in sport itâ€™s not just the luck but what you do with it when it comes, and Willis has taken advantage of this opportunity. Claytonâ€™s friends have been teasing him about it. â€œEveryone is saying: â€˜If you had played . .. blah blah blah. â€™â€ But as Clayton says: â€œYou canâ€™t take away what Marcus has done, he has beaten some serious players to get to this point, it is a major achievement and he deserves it. â€ Clayton adds: â€œAm I surprised that he made it to the second round of Wimbledon? Yes, I would never have expected that back at the start of his run. But am I surprised that he can play this way? No. Because he is a very good player and I have seen him play this way before. â€ Federer agreed. â€œWhat I like about his game is he reads it well. He knows when youâ€™re coming in. He can slice easily, even really deep in the court. He chips it really well,   and down the line. He sees when itâ€™s short and he steps into the court and he goes for it. â€ Federer had treated the match like he was playing a man in the top 50 â€œbecause thatâ€™s how well he was playingâ€. Willis has said heâ€™s going to be playing for his club in the Coventry leagues on Thursday night. It would be some comedown. But he is Â£50, 000 richer, and beyond that, as Federer says, â€œhe can make big stridesâ€. For Clayton itâ€™s been an inspiration. â€œThere is not a lot of money at all at the bottom of the game. It is very tough. You are nowhere near breaking even. Ultimately it can get very disheartening. â€ But then you never know, maybe next year it will be his turn. â€œTo see Marcus come through that, through qualifying, it gives us all a great reason to keep plugging away. Because it just shows, these things can happen. Theyâ€™re rare, but they can happen. â€ Bet that next year heâ€™ll be sure to turn up to play."
175339,636,tertiary,38,"Dealing with a flood of   pardon requests amounted to one of the biggest surprises of his presidency, George W. Bush once wrote. Bush declared himself â€disgustedâ€ by how many people exploited their connections to make personal appeals. Now, President Obama faces the same set of difficult decisions on the way out the door, with many   applicants requesting clemency in the presidentâ€™s final weeks in office. White House press secretary Josh Earnest recently warned applicants not to get their hopes up. â€He does not expect to essentially ram through any pardons at the last minute,â€ Earnest said. â€Thereâ€™s an established process and the president believes thatâ€™s a process thatâ€™s worth following.â€ And yet, thereâ€™s a long and checkered history for those   clemencies. Bill Clintonâ€™s pardon of the fugitive money man Marc Rich launched a federal grand jury investigation. George H. W. Bushâ€™s pardon of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the   scandal prompted a   of its own. And Gerald Fordâ€™s pardon of his predecessor, Richard Nixon, may have helped cost Ford his job. But for defendants facing decades in prison, thereâ€™s not much to lose by asking. One of those mounting a   bid for clemency is NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Snowdenâ€™s living in Russia under a grant of asylum, but under indictment in Virginia. â€The question of whether I as a whistle blower should be pardoned is not for me to answer,â€ Snowden said this year. â€But I will say this. I love my country, I love my family, and I have dedicated my life to both of them.â€ This month, Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee united to condemn the Snowden leaks, which probably argues against his plea for mercy. On the other hand, thereâ€™s the case of Chelsea Manning. Manning is the Army private who leaked a huge trove of military secrets to the website WikiLeaks. She has already served seven years behind bars, more time than anyone else, she argues, for disclosing documents in the public interest. ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio said her clemency petition is a matter of life or death. â€She absolutely will not survive her 35 year sentence,â€ Strangio said. â€She is a transgender woman in a menâ€™s facility. Sheâ€™s already attempted suicide twice and been punished with solitary confinement.â€ Two other prominent clemency applicants include Bowe Bergdahl, who faces   on charges that include desertion after going AWOL in Afghanistan, and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, caught in a sweeping public corruption case that includes trying to sell Barack Obamaâ€™s vacant seat in the U. S. Senate after he was elected president in 2008. And then, there are some cases tinged with history. Leonard Peltier is a Native American activist who has been in prison for 40 years, serving two consecutive life terms. In 1977, Peltier was convicted of killing two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. His case has been championed by Amnesty International, Hollywood celebrities and human rights activists who believe heâ€™s innocent and got scapegoated by the government. But the FBI has opposed any mercy for Peltier. As Bill Clinton was leaving office 16 years ago, federal agents even marched to the White House in a show of force. One of them was Thomas Oâ€™Connor, now president of the FBI Agents Association, who said recently, â€We wonâ€™t allow the Peltier legal and public relations teams to portray him for anything other than what he is, and thatâ€™s an unremorseful,   killer.â€ Thereâ€™s one more case from the history books. The adult children of Ethel Rosenberg, executed for spying on behalf of Russia in 1953, recently traveled to the White House gates with a special request. â€Weâ€™re not asking for a pardon weâ€™re asking for an exoneration,â€ said her son Robert Meeropol, who was just 6 years old when his mother died. Meeropol told the NPR program Here  Now that his motherâ€™s conviction was a perversion of justice. He pointed to documents liberated from archives in the U. S. and the former Soviet Union. Yet Meeropol said he has little hope   Donald Trump will view the petition favorably. So this may be the last chance for his family."
206460,637,tertiary,216,"         The Washington Postâ€™s national security team just registered another big scoop: Shortly before President Trumpâ€™s inauguration, Blackwater founder Erik Prince conducted a secret meeting with a Russian close to Vladimir Putin for the purposes of setting up a   line of communication between the Russian leader and Trump, according to U. S. Arab and European officials. The White House is already (sort of) denying that it has anything to do with this. â€œWe are not aware of any meetings, and Erik Prince had no role in the transition,â€ press secretary Sean Spicer said. A few things call this denial into question. The first is that Prince isnâ€™t just some businessman. He was a   Trump supporter who is close to Stephen K. Bannon and just happens to be the brother of Trumpâ€™s education secretary, Betsy DeVos. He was also seen at Trump Tower during the transition period and was advising Trump on intelligence and defense issues, according to the Intercept. And he definitely toed the Trump line on Russia and hacking. Heâ€™s not just some guy. The second is that the meeting was conducted in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean  â€”   a location that is known to be safe harbor for clandestine meetings. As a top Seychellois official put it so amazingly: â€œThe Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good time away from the eyes of the media. Thatâ€™s even printed in our tourism marketing. But I guess this time you smelled something. â€ Wow. In other words, Prince is undeniably close to the White House, and he was conducting a meeting with a Putin associate at a location where people conduct meetings that they donâ€™t want people to know about. Anonymous officials say that Prince presented himself as an unofficial Trump envoy to top officials in the United Arab Emirates, who brokered the meeting, and that it was intended to set up a   back channel. The White House and a Prince spokesman dispute that. As with so many developments in the   saga, it certainly looks suspicious and produces smoke. And as with so many developments, thereâ€™s still no smoking gun and plenty of anonymous sourcing and plausible deniability for the White House to latch on to. But in this case, the timing just looks bad. This meeting occurred around Jan. 11, according to The Postâ€™s Adam Entous, Greg Miller, Kevin Sieff and Karen DeYoung. Why is that important? Because just a week before, the U. S. intelligence community released its report accusing Russia of meddling in the 2016 election for the express purpose of aiding Trump. And a couple of weeks earlier, the Emirati who officials say arranged the Seychelles encounter  â€”   the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed    â€”   had made an undisclosed visit to meet with Bannon and top Trump advisers Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner, according to the officials. The UAE broke protocol by not informing the Obama administration of Mohammedâ€™s visit, but officials noticed his name on a flight manifest. With that as the backdrop, Mohammed apparently arranged for a person who had close ties to the Trump transition and could credibly be called an adviser to board a plane for a secretive location to meet with a Russian close to Putin. We donâ€™t yet know what alternative purpose this meeting might have held for Prince. A spokesman said that â€œErik had no role on the transition team. This is a complete fabricationâ€ and that â€œthe meeting had nothing to do with President Trump. â€ But given Princeâ€™s ties to Trumpworld, it was at the very least a particularly poor choice of times to go meet with a Putin associate and to look secretive in doing so. And the fact that those close to Trump keep making these meetings with Russians look so secretive is making this whole thing infinitely worse for him."

214266,639,primary,91,"         For years, ExxonMobil actively advanced the notion that its products had little or no impact on the Earthâ€™s environment. As recently as last year, it continued to fund organizations that play down the risks of carbon pollution. So what did ExxonMobil actually know about climate change? And when did it know it? Reasonable questions  â€”   particularly if ExxonMobil misled its investors about the   prospects of its business model or if the company fooled consumers into buying its products based on false claims. So now the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York are investigating whether ExxonMobil violated state laws by knowingly misleading their residents and shareholders about climate change. Those investigations may be making ExxonMobil executives nervous, and their Republican friends in Congress are riding to the rescue. House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith ( .) and his fellow committee Republicans have issued subpoenas demanding that the state officials fork over all materials relating to their investigations. They also targeted eight organizations, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Rockefeller Family Fund and Greenpeace, with similar subpoenas, demanding that they turn over internal communications related to what Smith describes as part of â€œcoordinated effortsâ€ to deprive ExxonMobil of its First Amendment rights. Take a breath to absorb that: State attorneys general are investigating whether a fraud had been committed  â€”   something state AGs do every day. Sometimes AGs uncover fraud and sometimes they donâ€™t, but if the evidence warrants it, the question of fraud will be resolved in open court, with all the evidence on public display. But instead of applauding the AGs for doing their jobs, this particular investigation against this particular oil company has brought down the wrath of congressional Republicans  â€”   and a swift effort to shut down the investigation before any evidence becomes public. So far, both AGs and all eight organizations have refused to comply. We say, good for them. Letâ€™s call this what it is: a master class in how big corporations rig the system. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Smith has received nearly $685, 000 in campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry during his career. Now he is using his committee to harass the investigators and bully those who dare bring facts of possible corporate malfeasance to their attention. Undoubtedly, the oil industry wants no further attention, much less   discovery, into whether it has spent decades deliberately deceiving the public about the harms associated with its product. So here come Smith and his Republican colleagues with threats of legal action designed to sidetrack state investigations and silence groups petitioning the government to address potential wrongdoing"
214266,640,secondary,325,"Thereâ€™s plenty for the AGs to investigate. The Union of Concerned Scientists, for example, issued a 2015 report, â€œClimate Deception Dossiers: Internal Fossil Fuel Industry Memos Reveal Decades of Corporate Disinformation,â€ and a 2007 report, â€œSmoke, Mirrors & Hot Air: How ExxonMobil Uses Big Tobaccoâ€™s Tactics to Manufacture Uncertainty on Climate Science. â€ Both reports document how the industry has protected its bottom line by funding front organizations and scientists to put out junk science contradicting what   scientists, and even the industryâ€™s own experts, were saying about how its products affected the environment. Union of Concerned Scientists President Ken Kimmell rightly dismissed the committeeâ€™s request, saying, â€œMr. Smith makes no allegation that UCS violated any laws or regulations, and his claim, that providing information to attorneys general infringes on ExxonMobilâ€™s rights, is nonsense. â€ Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman are also fighting back. In separate letters, they told Smith that they have no intention of complying with the committeeâ€™s request. â€œThe Subpoena brings us one step closer to a protracted, unnecessary legal confrontation which will only distract and detract from the work of our respective offices,â€ Schneiderman wrote"
214266,641,secondary,126,"Smith is not the first    Republican in Congress to come to the industryâ€™s defense.

So we have an alternative suggestion. If Chairmen Smith and Inhofe are concerned about the First Amendment rights of ExxonMobil, they should each call a hearing, ask ExxonMobil executives to testify, and give them the opportunity to set the record straight. A committee chairman could do little more to protect any personâ€™s right to speak freely than to give that person the chance to testify before Congress. We would love to hear what they have to say"

172419,645,tertiary,684,"For the first time in her life,    freelance designer Susannah Lohr had to shop for health insurance this year. She called up a major insurer in the St. Louis area where she lives, and it offered her a plan with a hefty $6, 000 deductible  â€”   thatâ€™s the amount she would have to cover herself before the insurance kicks in. When she balked, the salesman on the phone suggested that she could buy a â€gap plan,â€ a separate policy for $50 a month to cover her deductible. â€After I got off the phone with him, I realized: Thatâ€™s actually just insurance for my insurance,â€ she said, laughing. Gap plans, used to cover    expenses like high deductibles, are becoming increasingly popular among consumers and businesses. The rising price of insurance is driving the trend, explains insurance broker Ryan Hillenbrand, president of the Missouri Association of Health Underwriters. â€People see the prices of individual insurance and they say, â€™Boy, a $6, 000 deductible seems really high. I donâ€™t want something that gives me that much risk,â€™ â€ Hillenbrand says. â€Thatâ€™s why [the gap insurance] market is heating up a little bit more.â€ Gap insurance is in a category of insurance known as â€limited benefit.â€ No matter how bad a personâ€™s situation, the plan will pay out only a certain amount of money. â€ â€ policies, now illegal under the Affordable Care Act, are another example of a limited benefit plan, Now, thereâ€™s renewed interest in gap plans. With monthly premiums on health insurance going up, more people are choosing cheaper,   options. In 2016, more than 90 percent of people buying insurance under the ACA chose plans with an average deductible of $3, 000 or higher. Next year, the cost of one of the most popular plans available under the Affordable Care Act could increase by 10 percent on average across the country. That comes on top of a 5 percent jump the year before. When consumers see those prices, Hillenbrand says, â€they get sticker shock.â€ â€If you donâ€™t qualify for a subsidy, youâ€™re bearing the brunt of all that cost,â€ Hillenbrand says. â€And here come the gap plans.â€ About 8 in 10 people qualify for some form of subsidy on the Obamacare exchanges, helping to make insurance more affordable for consumers. Businesses, on the other hand, are facing those costs on their own. And for some businesses, especially smaller firms, gap plans can make a lot of sense, says Alex Forrest, an insurance broker in South Carolina. â€The cost of health insurance is going up and businesses have been forced to deal with that by raising their deductibles or increasing    costs for their employees,â€ he says. â€That stinks.â€ With a gap plan, he says, companies can offer a package of health benefits that keeps     for employees down. And they still spend less than they would with   plans with lower deductibles. Forrest says he has seen more gap insurance products for businesses come to market in the past few years. Theyâ€™re being marketed as a way to keep    expenses low for employees. This video explaining a plan called the â€Premium Saverâ€ boasts: â€The only thing thatâ€™s really different for you is, now, you have two [insurance] cards instead of one.â€ St. Louis footwear company Diba Imports, for example, purchases both a   health plan and a type of gap plan called â€hospital indemnity insuranceâ€ for its roughly 30 employees. â€It basically reimburses most of your deductible if you have an illness or injury that puts you in the hospital,â€ says Diane Butrus, the companyâ€™s COO. Butrus says that Diba used to pay the deductibles directly for its employees, but as those deductibles started rising, eventually up to $3, 000, â€we couldnâ€™t afford to do that anymore.â€ The unpredictability was especially hard for a small company like Diba. The cost of covering employee deductibles swung widely year to year, hitting $25, 000 one year when several employees needed serious care. The hospital indemnity plan only costs the company just under $50 a month per employee  â€”   not exactly cheap at about $18, 000 per year  â€”   but at least Diba knows exactly how much it will spend on insurance every year. â€Itâ€™s been very good,â€ says Butrus. Not everyone is bullish about gap plans, however, especially for individual buyers. Health economist Deborah Chollet of Mathematica Policy Research, an independent research firm, says the insurance reforms in the ACA were designed â€basically to drive these kinds of creative insurance arrangements out of the market.â€ Because gap plans arenâ€™t major medical insurance, Chollet explains, theyâ€™re not regulated by the health care law and can avoid complying with consumer protections built into the law. So the companies providing gap insurance, she says, â€can ask you about your health status, they can deny you coverage, they can do all of the kinds of things that the Affordable Care Act prohibits.â€ Chollet says individuals might be better off getting an Obamacare plan through their state exchange, or at least checking to see if they qualify for subsidies, as 80 percent of consumers on the exchanges do. Thatâ€™s what Lohr ended up doing. It took her three full days on HealthCare. gov to find the best plan, but after her tax credit, her monthly premium is about $200 and her deductible is just $600. Itâ€™s â€a much better plan,â€ she says. For people who are intimidated, overwhelmed or find the whole process of choosing a plan unmanageable, there are dozens of free health insurance navigators in each state  â€”   people you can talk to who will help you choose your coverage. Itâ€™s something Lohr wishes she had known about when she started searching for a plan. Editorâ€™s note at 5:20 p. m.

168446,646,secondary,793,"Of the 3 million students identified as gifted in the U. S. English Language Learners are by far the most underrepresented. And nobody knows that better than    Alejandra Galindo. â€Itâ€™s just kind of hard to not see people who look like me in my classes,â€ she says. â€Iâ€™m a minority in the gifted world.â€ Alejandra is a senior at North Canyon High School in Phoenix. Before she was identified as gifted, she was identified as an English Language Learner, or ELL. You know, those kids who are often assigned to separate classrooms while they learn English. That was Alejandra. â€She would cry and not want to go to school,â€ says her mom, Norma Galindo. â€She didnâ€™t want to be Hispanic. She didnâ€™t want to speak our language.â€ Norma Galindo is originally from El Salvador. Her husband, Arnulfo, is from Mexico. Theyâ€™ve always known their daughter was bright beyond her years. â€I remember Alejandra coming to me and saying, â€™Mom, Iâ€™m bored at school. Classes are so easy,â€™ â€ says Norma Galindo. â€And I said, â€™Youâ€™re not supposed to be bored at school. You need to be challenged.â€™ So I talked to her teacher and asked, â€™Can you do something for her?â€™ â€ Parents are usually the first ones to figure out that their child is gifted, but that message often doesnâ€™t get to the educators in schools. Many schools donâ€™t even test ELLs for giftedness, and most teachers arenâ€™t trained to identify those students. It doesnâ€™t have to be that way, says Alejandra. â€I think itâ€™s just all about letting those kids know that [they] have just as much potential as any other kid,â€ she says, â€regardless of your skin color or where your parents came from or what language you speak.â€ Alejandra was lucky. In fourth grade, a teacher singled her out and asked that she be tested. The results showed that her verbal reasoning skills were off the charts, a sign of giftedness not just in English but Spanish as well. â€Now that Iâ€™m older,â€ says Alejandra, â€I realize that being bilingual is very, very important. That in combination with being gifted, itâ€™s like so many doors have opened.â€ At North Canyon High, those doors have opened wide. Alejandra has excelled in just about every   course she has taken. Her academic success has motivated her to   her other gift, singing. Sheâ€™s a section leader on the school choir. With graduation right around the corner, Alejandra has set her sights on college and a career in international studies, maybe doing humanitarian work. Itâ€™s not clear how many Alejandras there are out there. Arizona has identified more than 80, 000 gifted students statewide, but that number is not broken down by race or ethnicity. Itâ€™s also impossible to know how many gifted ELLs are never identified and tested. Nationally, 32 states, including Arizona, mandate gifted education, according to the National Association For Gifted Children. Only four fully fund gifted programs, the organization says in this report. Few, if any, require that ELLs be tested. Thatâ€™s a problem says Chester Finn, a former U. S. assistant secretary of education and author of the recent book, Failing Our Brightest Kids. â€An awful lot of Latino kids are arriving with parents who are undocumented. They really do depend on schools to help them,â€ says Finn. â€[But] weâ€™re losing talent of kids from poorly educated parents who donâ€™t know their way around the American system.â€ Finn says schools must do more to reach out to    parents, and to train teachers to be more like talent scouts. Then, he adds, schools must give gifted ELLs as much academic enrichment as they can handle. No argument there, says Peter Laing. He oversees gifted education for Arizonaâ€™s Department of Public Instruction. Arizona currently does not provide any funding for gifted education. Laing says what little money gifted kids get has to come from local school districts. He says that, with the ELL population growing so fast in Arizona, educators and policymakers need to better serve those students, especially the brightest among them: â€This is a moral, ethical obligation on the part of schools.â€"
155837,647,primary,136,"Turkeyâ€™s foreign and justice ministers are due to travel to the US to demand the extradition of Fethullah GÃ¼len, the   Turkish imam accused by the government of masterminding the abortive coup attempt that led to the deaths of 265 people and the dismissal of tens of thousands of public servants. The Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdag on Thursday accused GÃ¼len of plotting the coup for decades, and said he would have returned to Turkey if the military plotters had not been thwarted. He had warned that GÃ¼len, who has lived in rural Pennyslvania for years, could flee the US to seek political asylum to Australia, Mexico, Canada, South Africa or Egypt. Turkish officials say they regard the evidence of GÃ¼len complicity as overwhelming, and that any failure by the US to cooperate with the extradition will have   consequences for   diplomatic relations. The US has denied any prior knowledge of the coup attempt, but Turkish officials have noted that the coup plotters included senior Turkish officers at the strategic Incirlik air base used by US fighter jets to bomb Syria. Some Turkish media outlets have claimed a former US general John Campbell, who retired from the   military coalition in Afghanistan in May, planned the failed coup. The allegation has been rejected as absurd. Turkey will have to present US authorities with a list of the criminal charges against GÃ¼len, proof that similar charges exist under US law, and a clear set of evidence that amounts to more than surmise or hearsay. The extradition warrant would have to be issued by a judge. American officials remain sceptical about the standard of evidence, and point out that GÃ¼len was once a political ally of President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan. Abdurrahman Bilgic, the Turkish ambassador to London, said: â€œWe have been warning friends and allies about the real motives and hidden agenda of this terrorist group and its leader, Fetullah GÃ¼len. The treacherous coup plot has revealed the real face of Fetullah GÃ¼len and his sinister organization. In fact, it was more than a plot. â€œWhat happened on the night of 15 July was an act of terror, killing hundreds of people wounding thousands. â€ Bilgic said that it was â€œcrystal clearâ€ that the coup attempt was led by a network of military officers affiliated with GÃ¼lenâ€™s organisation. He said: â€œRecent testimonies of those who played key roles in the plot all point to this direction. â€ The US response to the extradition request may be coloured by repeated warnings that Turkeyâ€™s parliament may reintroduce the death penalty for some of the coup plotters. US Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is committed to ending the death penalty, but is also an advocate of a more interventionist stance in Syria, and so is dependent on Turkish cooperation. Turkey is a member of Nato, and a turn away from the west would have massive strategic consequences. Bilgic said Turkeyâ€™s parliament will consider whether to reintroduce the death penalty in a calmer climate, but warned that a US refusal to extradite GÃ¼len would have wider consequences. Recent months have seen growing signs of a rapprochement between Turkey and Russian president Vladimir Putin, but Turkish officials insist this trend was underway before the coup and should not be seen as a reflection of any anger with the US. Turkish government is deepy frustrated at what it regards as the lack of western support for the wide crackdown in the wake of the coup. As part of a   state of emergency, the Turkish government has rounded up not just coup plotters in the army, but dissident journalists, 3, 000 judges, teachers, bankers and foreign ministry diplomats. Almost 16, 000 public servants have been detained and 50, 000 fired. Amnesty International said on Thursday that arrest warrants have been issued for 89 journalists, more than 40 have already been detained and others are in hiding. A second emergency decree passed on 27 July has resulted in the shutdown of 131 media outlets. Among the armed forcesâ€™ 325 most senior officers, 149 have been sacked and on Wednesday nearly 1, 700 personnel were dishonourably discharged for their role in the putsch, including about 40% of Turkeyâ€™s admirals and generals"

180929,650,tertiary,678," South Koreaâ€™s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co Ltd ( ) on Monday won near unanimous approval for a    swap plan in the first two of five bondholder meetings, as the worldâ€™s largest shipbuilder battles to stay afloat. The votes were held hours after Daewooâ€™s biggest bondholder, the National Pension Service (NPS) said it had agreed to the proposal. That move made it likely other bondholders would follow suit, creditor bank officials said, allowing the shipbuilder to meet conditions of a $2. 6 billion bank bailout. The shipbuilder has been pushed to the brink by the impact of historically low oil prices, which caused delays in payments for complex offshore facilities. At risk is an estimated 50, 000 jobs and an economic hit of tens of billions of dollars. Its predicament follows the bankruptcy and liquidation of compatriot Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd after creditors declined further support last year for what was the worldâ€™s   container shipper. â€Accepting the debt restructuring will be more advantageous to improve the fundâ€™s returns,â€ NPS, the worldâ€™s   pension fund, said in a statement earlier on Monday. Holders of about 1. 5 trillion won ($1. 32 billion) worth of Daewoo bonds must agree to swap half of debt owed to them for equity, and allow Daewoo to suspend repayment of the rest for three years, so Daewoo can meet conditions for $2. 6 billion worth of financial assistance from state banks. Five meetings have been planned for Monday and Tuesday to discuss the proposal. Agreement came from 99. 99 percent of bondholders present at the first meeting where attendance reached 80 percent, and 98. 99 percent at the second with 89 percent attendance. The proposal is likely to be approved at all meetings as large bondholders such as Korea Post are likely to follow the lead of the NPS due to the fundâ€™s size and influence, creditor bank officials said. The officials declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Korea Post told Reuters it decided to agree to the proposal after the NPS agreement was made public. SHARING THE PAIN The NPS is Daewooâ€™s largest bondholder, with about 390 billion won worth of bonds, Yonhap reported. It accepted the proposal after Korea Development Bank (KDB) [KDB. UL] and   Bank of Korea (KEXIM) [KEXIM. UL] agreed to store bond payments in an escrow account before bonds mature, and after they effectively pledged to pay bondholders before pursuing their own claims, creditor bank officials said. â€We decided to approve the proposal after considering KDB and KEXIMâ€™s measures reinforcing the repayment of bonds whose maturity will be extended,â€ an NPS spokesman told Reuters. The two banks have supported Daewoo with 4. 2 trillion won since October 2015, adding to a state bailout in the late 1990s during the Asian financial crisis. To justify more, â€all stakeholders must share the painâ€ the Financial Services Commission said when setting the    condition. The government plans to sell its stake in Daewoo after shrinking the shipbuilder over two years to a company generating revenue of 7 trillion won from about 13 trillion won last year, KDB Chairman Lee   said at a news briefing on Sunday. Daewoo reported a net loss of 2. 8 trillion won last year"

195911,652,primary,86," President Donald Trump just canâ€™t stop talking about voter fraud. In a   meeting with senators on Thursday, participants told Politico that Trump ranted as former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte was in the room about how she would have won her reelection in November if â€œthousandsâ€ of people werenâ€™t â€œbrought in on busesâ€ from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to vote â€œillegally. â€    Like other Trump conspiracy theories about voter fraud, there is zero evidence for his claim. But this isnâ€™t the first time Trump has made these kinds of claims in front of members of Congress, previously telling congressional leaders, the Associated Press reported, that â€œhe would have won the popular vote in the 2016 election if 3 million to 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally hadnâ€™t voted. â€ All of that followed months of comments by Trump  â€”   as a candidate for president, as   and now as president  â€”   about voter fraud. â€œIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide,â€ he tweeted in November, â€œI won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. â€ The comments appeared to culminate late in January when, in a series of tweets, Trump announced that he would launch an investigation into voter fraud. But that investigation has yet to be officially unveiled"
195911,653,primary,109,"        Related    Jeff Sessions, Trumpâ€™s attorney general, will be a massive setback for civil rights  Trumpâ€™s main source for his claims is an old Pew report, whose authors have repeatedly said that it does not support Trumpâ€™s claim at all. It doesnâ€™t even look at voter fraud, but rather at Americaâ€™s lackluster technology for registering voters"
195911,654,primary,33,"  More broadly, respected research on voter fraud has found again and again that itâ€™s extremely rare in the US. At most, there might be a few hundred fraudulent votes in national elections  â€”   in which well over 100 million people can vote. â€œThe claim that there were millions of illegal voters in this past election is false and unsupported by any credible evidence,â€ Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California Irvine, wrote. â€œThe National Association of Secretaries of State, made up of the chief election officers of all 50 states, just issued a statement saying so. â€    Still, Republicans have pushed the myth of widespread voter fraud for years  â€”   to justify new voting restrictions  â€”   as a political tactic: Depressed voter turnout almost always favors the GOP by hitting disproportionately Democratic demographics, making new hurdles to voting attractive to Republican politicians. And Trump, similarly, could use his investigation into voter fraud to justify new national restrictions on voting. â€œA shoddy investigation could be a pretext for imposing new laws making it harder for people, especially people likely to vote for Democrats, to register and vote,â€ Hasen told me. So while itâ€™s easy to dismiss Trumpâ€™s doubling, tripling, and quadrupling down on this myth as bluster, it can have real consequences  â€”   consequences that reach into the most basic, fundamental right that American citizens share"
195911,655,primary,41,"  The research is clear: Voter fraud is rare to nonexistent There have been multiple investigations  â€”   by academics, journalists, and nonpartisan think tanks  â€”   into voter fraud. None found evidence of anything close to millions of people voting illegally. Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt studied voter impersonation, the type of fraud that strict voter ID laws (which Trump supports) aim to curtail. Levitt found 35 total credible accusations between 2000 and 2014, constituting a few hundred ballots at most. During this   period, more than 800 million ballots were cast in national general elections and hundreds of millions more were cast in primary, municipal, special, and other elections"
195911,656,primary,96,"  (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === â€™undefinedâ€™)   else   })();   A 2012 investigation by the News21 journalism project looked at all kinds of voter fraud nationwide, including voter impersonation, people voting twice, vote buying, absentee fraud, and voter intimidation. It confirmed that voter impersonation was extremely rare, with just 10 credible cases. But the other types of fraud werenâ€™t common either: In total, the project uncovered 2, 068 alleged election fraud cases from 2000 through part of 2012, covering a time span when more than 620 million votes were cast in national general elections alone. That represents about 0. 000003 alleged cases of fraud for every vote cast, and 344 fraud cases per national general election, in each of which between 80 million and 135 million people voted. The number of fraudulent votes was a drop in the bucket. Whatâ€™s more, not all  â€”   maybe not even half  â€”   of these alleged fraud cases were credible, News21 found: â€œOf reported   allegations in the database whose resolution could be determined, 46 percent resulted in acquittals, dropped charges or decisions not to bring charges. â€ Trump and his team, in his defense, have cited a 2012 report from the Pew Center on the States as evidence for their claim. But the report didnâ€™t even focus on voter fraud. Instead, it looked the technical aspects of voter registration systems, and how America could save money by upgrading how it registers voters"
195911,657,tertiary,20,"   As part of that, the Pew report found that more than 1. 8 million registered voters were actually dead, while 2. 75 million had registrations in more than one state. This is where Trump apparently got his â€œmillionsâ€ figure"
195911,658,tertiary,51,"           But that doesnâ€™t mean that even one of these registrations was used for illegal votes. America has a   system for voting: You register, then vote. The report only shows that people registered and were never taken off the rolls. They didnâ€™t even have to register for the latest election  â€”   some of them registered for the 2008 election, then died or moved, and states just didnâ€™t take them off their rolls. So someone could have simply registered in Ohio in 2008, moved to Pennsylvania by 2012, and simply forgotten to notify Ohioâ€™s elections system that he had moved  â€”   even though he never had any intention of voting in Ohio again. For example, Steve Bannon, Trumpâ€™s chief strategist and senior counselor, reportedly voted for Trump in New York. But it turns out that he was also still registered to vote in Florida last year, because he never officially deregistered in the Sunshine State, even though he didnâ€™t vote there. And David Becker, who worked on the 2012 Pew report, unequivocally said that the report found â€œzero evidence of fraud. â€ That doesnâ€™t mean voter fraud has never happened and never had an impact. The New York Times, for instance, reported on a 1997 case in which it was revealed that Miami Mayor Xavier SuÃ¡rez clinched his electoral victory â€œwith the help of hundreds of absentee ballots bearing the names of dead people, felons and other ineligible voters. â€ While SuÃ¡rez was never charged, he was eventually forced to step down from office after an appellate court threw out the absentee ballots. But this type of situation, the empirical evidence and experts suggest, is likely far too rare to swing much bigger elections. When debating whether to do something about voter fraud, then, itâ€™s important to consider whether the potential downsides  â€”   such as making it harder for people of color to vote or sowing doubt in US elections  â€”   are worth the upside of stopping a tiny number of fraudulent votes. Otherwise, you might get prominent politicians like Trump casting doubt on the entire electoral process"
195911,659,tertiary,73,"  The voter fraud myth has been used repeatedly to suppress voters It would be one thing if this were just a ridiculous myth that the president was shouting into Twitter. But this exact myth of widespread voter fraud has repeatedly led to actual changes in law and policy. Notably, Trump isnâ€™t the first Republican, or even Republican presidential candidate, to raise concerns about voter fraud. In 2008, many Republicans and conservative media outlets like Fox News promoted fears that ACORN  â€”   a community organization that focused in part on registering   voters  â€”   was engaging in   election fraud. At the time, Republican nominee John McCain warned that ACORN â€œis now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. â€ (Again, there was zero evidence of this, and it did not happen.) And the myth that undocumented immigrants in particular are voting illegally has been promoted for years by   conspiracy websites like Infowars  â€”   citing a highly criticized 2014 report, even though one of its authors has said it didnâ€™t find proof of widespread voter fraud. Touting these kinds of concerns, 14 states passed new voting restrictions  â€”   from strict photo ID requirements to limits on early voting  â€”   that were in place for the 2016 election: Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Other states passed restrictions, but theyâ€™re currently tied up in court battles"
195911,660,primary,36,"  (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === â€™undefinedâ€™)   else   })();   Republican leaders have also embraced other tactics that limit peopleâ€™s ability to vote, including purging voter rolls, going after voter registration groups, and closing down polling places. These efforts were all emboldened by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that weakened the Voting Rights Act, which banned discrimination at the voting booth, by limiting federal oversight of changes certain states make to their voting laws"
195911,661,primary,15,"  Statesâ€™ measures typically target voter impersonation. They require a certain kind of ID to vote  â€”   Texas, for example, allows   IDs (including concealed gun permits) but not student IDs. This, obviously, makes it much harder for someone to impersonate another voter. But statesâ€™ voting restrictions can also take other steps that donâ€™t seem to target fraud so much as make voting more difficult. North Carolinaâ€™s law, for example, also eliminated some early voting days, ended   voter registration and    voting, and stopped the preregistration of   and    in the state. Republicans, who tend to push for these laws at the state level, nonetheless insist that their goal is to limit voter fraud. And for years, they have echoed rhetoric like McCainâ€™s and Trumpâ€™s to convince people that voter fraud really is a big problem that requires burdensome laws to fix. A previous report by the US Department of Justice captured the sentiment among many Republicans: Rep"
195911,662,primary,106,"Sue Burmeister, a lead sponsor of Georgiaâ€™s voter restriction law, told the Justice Department that â€if there are fewer black voters because of this bill, it will only be because there is less opportunity for fraud. [Burmeister] said that when black voters in her black precincts are not paid to vote, they do not go to the polls.â€ Other Republicans, such as former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and Iowa Rep. Steve King, have similarly warned about the dangers of voter fraud"
195911,663,primary,45,"So as much as Trump is a political aberration in many respects, he really isnâ€™t out of line with the typical Republican rhetoric on voter fraud. Still, that doesnâ€™t diminish the very real consequences of his rhetoric. Trumpâ€™s investigation could be a pathway to national voting restrictions Not only could Trumpâ€™s words cast doubt on the entire electoral system in the US  â€”   a system that relies largely on people believing that itâ€™s fair  â€”   but Trump could use the claims and his federal investigation, potentially led by the US Department of Justice, to justify a crackdown"
195911,664,secondary,97,"  An investigation could do some good. Hasen notes that if it, like past investigations into election issues in 2000, 2004, and 2008, takes a nonpartisan approach with a commission of election experts from both political parties, it could help get to the bottom of all of these issues and finally put them to rest. But he cautioned that â€œthere is no reason to believe that any investigation Trump orders would be fair and a search for the truth. â€ (For one, the White House later said that the investigation will focus on the bigger states that Trump lost  â€”   suggesting a vendetta of sorts.) Levitt of Loyola Law School agreed, arguing that Trumpâ€™s investigation seems more about looking for facts that prove his argument rather than getting to the truth of the matter. â€œNormally I have more confidence in the integrity of an investigation that doesnâ€™t announce the conclusion before the investigation starts,â€ he said. â€œIt sure looks like thereâ€™s an answer that thereâ€™s now to be an investigation to find the facts for. â€     For example, if the investigation finds, like the 2012 Pew report did, that there are millions of outdated voter registrations, Trump and Republicans could stretch that finding to justify a national voter ID law or mass purge of the voter rolls. When states have done the latter, itâ€™s led to many legitimate voters losing access to the ballot without any notification, simply because they didnâ€™t update their addresses or didnâ€™t read their mail, or officials used faulty databases for their purges. And if Trump wants to pursue a massive voter purge, he could, citing his fear of undocumented immigrants voting, use an existing federal database for it: the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database (SAVE) which is used to identify immigrants eligible for social services"
195911,665,primary,31,"States like Colorado, Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina have tried to use SAVE in the past for voter purges. But the Obama administration warned that the database wasnâ€™t designed for it and could mistakenly flag immigrants whoâ€™d since become US citizens  â€”   which is exactly what happened. The result: Potentially thousands of people were wrongly removed from the voter rolls  â€”   and many more could be wrongly removed if Trump takes a similar path"
195911,666,tertiary,103,"  This is the kind of problem that advocacy groups are worried about in the coming days. â€œThe President swore to uphold the Constitution just five days ago. That includes the right to vote. That is what the highest officials in the land should preserve, protect, and defend. The stakes for democracy couldnâ€™t be higher,â€ Brennan Center for Justice president Michael Waldman said in a statement. â€œThere is no evidence of massive voter fraud  â€”   none. The notion that millions of people voted illegally two months ago, and nobody noticed, is preposterous on its face. Election officials, leaders of the Presidentâ€™s own party, and every academic and journalistic investigation confirm this. â€ And based on the evidence, minority voters  â€”   who are, conveniently for Trump, more likely to vote Democrat  â€”   would very likely suffer the worst of these consequences. Voter fraud fears can lead to racist consequences   voting restrictions donâ€™t affect everyone equally. Time and time again, the evidence has shown that they tend to keep eligible minority voters in particular from casting a ballot  â€”   and Republicans have at times admitted that this was their intent. Some studies suggest voter ID laws make it particularly harder for black and brown Americans to vote. One widely cited 2006 study by the Brennan Center found voter ID laws, for instance, disproportionately impacted eligible black voters: 25 percent of black   citizens did not have a   photo ID, compared with 8 percent of white   citizens. And a study for the Black Youth Project, which analyzed 2012 voting data for people ages 18 to 29, found 72. 9 percent of young black voters and 60. 8 percent of young Hispanic voters were asked for IDs to vote, compared with 50. 8 percent of young white voters. One reason for these kinds of numbers is disparate enforcement  â€”   polling officials, perhaps driven by racial biases, appear more likely to ask minority voters for an ID"
195911,667,primary,27,"          But minority voters are also generally hit harder by voter ID laws and other restrictions on voting. For example, since minority Americans are less likely to have flexible work hours or own cars, they might have a harder time affording a voter ID or getting to the right place (typically a DMV or BMV office) to obtain a voter ID, rely more on early voting opportunities to cast a ballot, or require a nearby voting place instead of one thatâ€™s a drive, instead of a walk, away from home or work"
195911,668,secondary,9,"  For civil rights groups, the restrictions call back to the days of poll taxes, literacy tests, and other rules that were imposed to block minorities from voting until the Voting Rights Act effectively banned such laws. Like modern voting restrictions, the old laws didnâ€™t appear to racially discriminate at face value  â€”   but due to selective enforcement and socioeconomic disparities, they disproportionately kept out black voters. Again, minority voters tend to lean Democratic. So Republicans are effectively making it harder for the other partyâ€™s voters to vote. Some Republicans have even admitted that this is the goal of the new wave of voting restrictions. As William Wan reported for the Washington Post:  Longtime Republican consultant Carter Wrenn, a fixture in North Carolina politics, said the GOPâ€™s voter fraud argument is nothing more than an excuse. â€Of course itâ€™s political. Why else would you do it?â€ he said, explaining that Republicans, like any political party, want to protect their majority. While GOP lawmakers might have passed the law to suppress some voters, Wrenn said, that does not mean it was racist. â€Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was,â€ Wrenn said. â€It wasnâ€™t about discriminating against African Americans. They just ended up in the middle of it because they vote Democrat.â€  The US Department of Justice is supposed to act as a check on these kinds of voter suppression efforts. But under Republican administrations, the agency has approached voting rights cases with a lack of serious interest  â€”   with the Bush administration in particular known for effectively treating civil rights enforcement as a joke"
195911,669,secondary,39,"  With Trumpâ€™s nomination of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has opposed key parts of the Voting Rights Act throughout his career, the Trump administration looks poised to take a careless approach. In fact, it might even set aside resources toward supporting statesâ€™ voter suppression efforts by dedicating time and money to investigating and cracking down on voter fraud  â€”   exactly what Trump is now suggesting. Now, the research shows that voter ID laws and other voting restrictions have a fairly small overall impact on elections, at most reducing turnout by a percentage point or two. But even if voting restrictions donâ€™t have a big effect on the ultimate outcome of elections, they still appear to disproportionately keep minority voters from exercising their most basic democratic right  â€”   a problem no matter how you slice it. And itâ€™s a problem thatâ€™s perpetuated through a total myth: a false claim that thereâ€™s a lot of voter fraud in America when the evidence simply shows otherwise"

Hogeg told Reuters the phone would sell for less than $20, 000.

Two of its largest  â€”   Europa and Ganymede  â€”   likely contain subsurface oceans, providing tempting spots to go looking for life. But while potentially habitable waters may be especially intriguing to us earthlings, Jupiterâ€™s innermost moon Io is nothing to sneeze at, either"
214125,674,secondary,397," [Why scientists are so excited about the Juno probe that is finally orbiting Jupiter]   Itâ€™s a world practically bursting with intense volcanic activity that has unique interactions with its host planet. Scientists believe, for example, that these eruptions  â€”   which are the result of the intense gravitational energy Jupiter exerts on its moon  â€”   might somehow help create the extravagant auroral light displays detected on Jupiter. And now, a new study shows another unique connection between Io and Jupiter: Ioâ€™s atmosphere collapses every time it passes into Jupiterâ€™s shadow, and scientists just watched it happen for the first time ever. They published their results Tuesday in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. Okay, so, letâ€™s pause. What does it mean for an atmosphere to collapse? Scientists already knew that Ioâ€™s grip on its atmosphere was tenuous at best, and they suspected that it might frequently be lost to space and recreated by volcanic activity. The mostly   atmosphere has a surface pressure just one billionth of the one on Earth at sea level"
214125,675,tertiary,97," [Researchers captured a stunning image of one of the brightest volcanoes in the solar system]   Every time Jupiter passes in between Io and the sun, casting the moon into cold darkness (from a balmy   degrees Fahrenheit in sunlight to   degrees in shadow, to be precise) that sulfur dioxide gas cools and drops down to the surface, freezing into a solid. The atmosphere is collapsed and trap as surface ice for about two hours every day on Io (which equates to 1. 7 Earth days). And after that two hours, the atmosphere is reborn: The ( ) warmth of the sun casts itself upon Ioâ€™s surface once again, causing the   frost to sublimate, or heat from a solid back into a gas. â€This confirms that Ioâ€™s atmosphere is in a constant state of collapse and repair, and shows that a large fraction of the atmosphere is supported by sublimation of SO2 ice,â€ John Spencer of the Southwest Research Institute, one of the studyâ€™s   said in a statement. â€Though Ioâ€™s hyperactive volcanoes are the ultimate source of the SO2, sunlight controls the atmospheric pressure on a daily basis by controlling the temperature of the ice on the surface. Weâ€™ve long suspected this, but can finally watch it happen.â€ NASA recently inserted its new Juno probe into Jupiterâ€™s orbit, but the latest findings donâ€™t come from that spacecraft (which wonâ€™t start returning data in earnest until later this month). Scientists used the   Gemini North telescope in Hawaii and the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) to confirm the atmosphere collapse. The fact that the phenomenon occurs during eclipse  â€”   when Io is shrouded in darkness  â€”   made it difficult to study with most telescopes, so scientists had to look for changes in the atmosphereâ€™s heat radiation signature instead. But while Juno wasnâ€™t involved in the data collection, the new study shows just how much we stand to learn from NASAâ€™s probe.

Supreme Court on Wednesday began weighing what has become one of the most troubling questions on Wall Street: When does sharing confidential corporate information with a family member become a crime?

Salman appealed, arguing in part that Maher Kara had not received money, gifts or any other reward in exchange for the tips.

It was unclear during the   oral arguments how the justices were leaning on the issue, but legal experts have said it is significant that the case reached them at all. The Supreme Court hasnâ€™t heard an insider trading case in more than 20 years, and the outcome of this one could define an important aspect of the law, changing the landscape for such prosecutions for decades to come. â€œObviously the integrity of the markets are a very important thing for this country. And youâ€™re asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that threatens that integrity,â€ Justice Elena Kagan said while challenging the defenseâ€™s argument.

Obama said at one point in his speech on Wednesday night, â€That is not the America I know.â€ And Donald Trump Jr. used that exact same line just a week prior  â€”   albeit with a contraction: â€We will not accept the current state of our country because itâ€™s too hard to change. Thatâ€™s not the America I know.â€ Case closed. Itâ€™s plagiarism. The mediaâ€™s double standard at work, yet again. Except that, by this standard, Obama didnâ€™t plagiarize the line from Trump Jr. until Trump Jr. had already plagiarized it from him. Obama, after all, has said this phrase on several occasions. And that wasnâ€™t even its first bout of plagiarizing; none other than George W. Bush used it before Obama. NBC News ably recapped the rampant plagiarism here: During an economic address in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2010, for example, he said â€Instead of setting our sights higher, theyâ€™re asking us to settle for a status quo of stagnant growth and eroding competitiveness and a shrinking middle class. Cleveland, that is not the America I know. That is not the America we believe in.â€ . .. The use of the â€America I knowâ€ refrain was also a common phrase for former president George W. Bush. In the days after the   attacks, for example, Bush spoke about his view of the country during a visit to an Islamic center. â€Women who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes. Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America,â€ he said. â€Thatâ€™s not the America I know. Thatâ€™s not the America I value.â€ But the plagiarism doesnâ€™t stop there. Before Obama   something Trump Jr. had plagiarized from him after Obama plagiarized it from Bush, you see, Bush plagiarized it, too. From Walter Cronkite, in fact. Cronkite said it in 1998 in an interview with CNNâ€™s Wolf Blitzer: â€This is some kind of a resurgent Puritanism that suggests that we all should live by someone elseâ€™s moral standards.

Itâ€™s a picture of   jobs with high wages, advanced manufacturing in a vital industry  â€”   how things look when American workers are competing and winning  â€”   and Vermontâ€™s junior senator is always welcome to come by for a tour"

We are competing globally with foreign companies whose governments care whether they win and support them in innumerable ways. U.

217052,701,primary,59,"     Election Day was a blowout for the cause of legal marijuana. Ballot measures legalizing medical or recreational cannabis use passed for the first time in seven states, with a defeat in Arizona the only setback for activists. But, as the experiences of other   states show, the thorniest debates are just starting. How should the trade be regulated? Who will benefit financially? How will the federal government act? These questions and others will roil the states for years to come. The presidential and congressional election results have already put some of these measures in peril. Activists knew that an overwhelming show of support for marijuana ballot initiatives could be interpreted as a mandate for lawmakers to reconsider the federal prohibition on the plant. (President Obama added to these hopes by saying that if just five of these states decided to allow a form of cannabis use, that would mean that â€œa fifth of the country [is] operating under one set of laws, and   in another. .â€‰.â€‰. That is not going to be tenable. â€) The new political landscape, however  â€”   with   Donald Trump set to take office alongside a   House and Senate  â€”   signals that, despite a groundswell of popular support for marijuana legalization and its growing geographic footprint in America, ending the plantâ€™s federal prohibition is unlikely to be a legislative or executive priority. Trumpâ€™s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.) has said that â€œgood people donâ€™t smoke marijuana â€ and that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was â€œokay until I found out they smoked pot . â€ (An early contender for the job, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, promised in the Republican primary race that heâ€™d terminate legal marijuana in all 50 states.) This doesnâ€™t suggest an extension of the Obama administrationâ€™s noninterference policy. Journalist Tobias   also raises the disturbing possibility that an   attorney general  â€”   Sessionsâ€™s opposition to immigration is well known  â€”   might not disrupt state cannabis initiatives entirely, but could selectively enforce federal drug laws against immigrants and people of color in the cannabis industry. But even if appointed officials honor Trumpâ€™s professed respect for statesâ€™ rights  legalization is just the start of a protracted dialogue over how to craft cannabis policy. States that legalized marijuana earlier have contended with unanticipated consequences, as well as social and legal disputes over the rules of a newly sanctioned industry. Take Pueblo, Colo. which became the stateâ€™s   hub of marijuana production after legalization in 2012. The city voted on two measures in this election, both proposing local bans on the cannabis industry. Proponents argued that legalization has attracted a migration of homeless people from neighboring states, overburdening social services. The measures, in a town where the new industry has yielded thousands of jobs, were soundly rejected. But other cities, such as Los Angeles  are now studying the link between the availability of cannabis and the movements of homeless people, wondering whether to use the tax revenue from cannabis to expand homeless services or just leave them as public costs that other taxpayers are irritated about subsidizing. In California, more than 50 municipalities that correctly anticipated the passage of Proposition 64 (which legalizes and regulates â€œadult useâ€ cannabis in the state) also drafted ballot measures to impose local taxes on pot, all but one of which passed. While tax revenue has helped sell skeptics on the benefits of legalization, if taxes are too severe, they risk driving consumers back to underground suppliers. Proposition 64â€™s proposed statewide tax was controversial: Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a   lobbying group, called it â€œinordinately highâ€ and predicted that it would â€œencourage a lot of   activity for the foreseeable future. â€ Steep local taxes could compound this problem, as cities in California passed levies ranging from 3 to 20 percent, which, on top of the state tax, means that for some the cost of medical marijuana will rise by 27 percent. In Montana, where voters originally approved medical marijuana in 2004, voters chose to reform the law this year after a   legislature repealed the original act and replaced it with a far more limited version in 2011. While state Democrats at the time agreed that the original program was too permissive and sponsored the replacement, Republicans added restrictive provisions such as a rule limiting medical marijuana providers to three patients each, suddenly leaving 93 percent of registered patients without any legal means of procuring their medication. The new program voters passed this month is eventually expected to restore access for those temporarily dislocated from a legal supplier. Aside from the legislative and social growing pains of legal pot, municipalities have ethical issues to consider  â€”   namely, who stands to benefit from these new laws. California, recognizing that people of color were most affected by racially biased enforcement of cannabis prohibition, made history with its answer: Itâ€™s the first legalization initiative to allow drug offenders to participate in the sector from the start, as well as to include reparations for communities torn apart by drug policy. The   campaign explicitly argued that itâ€™s unethical to permanently disenfranchise previous offenders for an act that a majority of voters now deem acceptable. Relatedly, Marylandâ€™s Legislative Black Caucus has raised concerns about the fairness and diversity of license distribution for that stateâ€™s developing medical marijuana program. As these cases demonstrate, legalization often raises surprising social and economic complications that can elicit new resistance. Cannabis consumers and others in legalized communities have good reason to pay attention to these challenges, as they will probably be called on to vote on cannabis regulations again as the industry matures and new concerns crop up. Cases like Pueblo and Montana serve as reminders that policy regression can be as easy as progress. Itâ€™s also important for the voting public not to merely settle for marijuana legalization as presented, but to put political pressure on their representatives to ensure that cannabis policy mitigates potentially harmful outcomes, such as burdensome taxation, unequal opportunity in the industry and disruption to consumersâ€™ medical needs. Given the possibility that state legalization projects could be subject to federal interference (or even prosecution of participants) citizens may need to turn up the heat on their lawmakers to convince them that access to legal cannabis, given the diversity of states now supporting its medical or recreational use, is finally a bipartisan value."
156005,702,primary,228,"Hillary Clintonâ€™s historic confirmation as the first woman to become a major partyâ€™s presidential nominee gives her the chance to redefine her personal connection with the American people, advisers said. After a storm of bad news on a divided opening day in Philadelphia, and with Democratic delegates set to formally nominate her to lead their bid for the White House, Bill Clinton was at the centre of this new push to bring to life his wifeâ€™s sometimes flat campaign. â€œShe is the most famous,   person in the country,â€ her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters in Philadelphia, 15 months into her second campaign. â€œPeople know her rÃ©sumÃ©   â€¦     what we want people to know tonight is whatâ€™s that core value that has enabled her to do this. â€ Former president Clinton was due to be joined onstage by the singer Alicia Keys and a video tribute led by Meryl Streep in a night that intended to refocus attention on the winning candidate after 1, 846 delegates take turns to cast their votes for her failed opponent Bernie Sanders. Though Michelle Obama drew widespread praise for helping heal party wounds on Monday night, Democrats are increasingly worried that scenes of division may exacerbate a recent surge in support for Donald Trump. â€œPoll after poll is showing that Trump has been eating away at our lead, and after his convention, heâ€™s erased it entirely,â€ warned a campaign fundraising email to Clinton supporters on Monday as the Republican nominee took his biggest average lead yet"
156005,703,secondary,695,"Clintonâ€™s campaign has downplayed the new polls, attributing Trumpâ€™s rise to an expected   bounce. Before the Philadelphia convention began on Monday, Clintonâ€™s campaign manager, Robby Mook, warned reporters that any analysis based on the polls was premature until after the Democrats had their chance to make their case to the American people. But Palmieri acknowledged that Clinton had work to do to repair votersâ€™ lack of trust in her. Just three in 10 Americans believe Clinton is â€œhonest and trustworthyâ€ her lowest rating by this measure in CNNâ€™s polling, according to findings published on Monday ahead of the convention"
156005,704,tertiary,38,"â€œWe do polls, we see [them] sheâ€™s acknowledged that she has work to do to earn peopleâ€™s trust,â€ said Palmieri. â€œShe realises that there arenâ€™t magic words that you can say that develop that trust overnight. â€  Clinton, who has been on the public stage since the 1980s, has a long record which opponents, both left and right, have used to criticise her  â€”   from voting for the Iraq war to keeping her state department emails on a private server. Sanders supporters have also used her voting record on trade and her close links to Wall Street as evidence that she does not represent change. Campaign staff put a brave face on the tumultuous scenes of open revolt among some Sanders supporters, who confirmed on Tuesday he would be returning to the US Senate as an independent, not a Democrat. During his speech on Monday night, his supporters booed when he praised Clinton and erupted into angry shouting when he said in closing: â€œIâ€™m proud to stand with her. â€ Outside the arena, protesters had marched through downtown Philadelphia denouncing the â€œriggedâ€ political system. Periodically, protesters broke into chants of â€œLock her up!â€ a memorable refrain from the Republican national convention. â€œIn this room are Hillary Clintonâ€™s most passionate supporters and Bernie Sandersâ€™ most passionate supporters,â€ Palmieri said. â€œThere are the actual delegates, the people who not just believe in their candidate but were selected to represent the people who voted for their candidate, so they feel really strong about that"
156005,705,primary,655,"â€œIt is something to respect and it is also something that has made our partyâ€™s nominating process, our partyâ€™s primary much more substantive and productive than what youâ€™ve seen on the Republican side, which was a race to the bottom. â€  But the job of the convention now is to capitalise on the historic nature of Clintonâ€™s win  â€”   as the      reaching higher than a woman has gone before in US politics. She must now try to match the passion which Sanders inspired as she urges peopleto get behind her and her running mate, Tim Kaine, seen as a solid choice rather than an exciting one. Advisers acknowledged that the pair â€œare people who work hard, not so much show horses but workhorsesâ€. â€œThey know how to make progress. Sometimes we are asked, â€˜Hillary Clinton has been at it for a long time,â€™ and we are asked if that is the right candidate for an election that is about change, and the answer is yes   â€¦     thatâ€™s what she has been doing for four decades,â€ said Palmieri. On the trail during primary season, Bill Clinton compared his wife with other candidates, saying â€œher jobs ideas are betterâ€ and telling crowds: â€œYou will never have a chance to have a president that is a better    â€”   sheâ€™s the best at it I have ever seen. â€ The story of a candidate who failed to secure the nomination in 2008 will now be recast as a story of determination  â€”   a theme which Michelle Obama identified in her hugely affecting speech on Monday. She said Clinton had â€œthe guts and the grace to keep coming backâ€ after defeat"
156005,706,tertiary,454,"â€œThe story of the president and Hillary Clinton as former rivals that came together to be partners,â€ explained Palmieri. â€œAnd now sheâ€™s seeking to succeed him and him being such a gracious and aggressive supporter of hers   â€¦     Itâ€™s also a remarkable story that we might follow the first African American president with the first woman president. â€"

Can I see your ID?â€     My first thought: Oh, great, I literally just arrived in Germany and a police officer is asking me questions. Am I doing something wrong?    I told him I didnâ€™t carry my ID. All I had were my apartment keys"
203712,711,secondary,940,He continued to ask me questions: â€œWhere do you live?â€ â€œWhy are you here so early?â€    I told him I was sorry that I didnâ€™t have my ID and would remember to carry it with me next time

I assumed it was a   thing, or maybe there was an ordinance of some sort for running in the park that early in the morning I didnâ€™t know about. As a woman of color, I didnâ€™t think race could be a reason why he stopped me. I just figured it was because I was the only person in the park. I also didnâ€™t think I would encounter the police again for the duration of my   fellowship at Correctiv, an investigative nonprofit newsroom in Berlin, unless I had to talk to them for a story"
203712,714,secondary,956,"When I got back to my apartment I recalled the conversations Iâ€™d had with a few people I knew in Berlin about racism in Germany. They told me Berlin was generally safe and that I should avoid the some of the smaller Eastern towns in Germany, where I might run into  . The only checks I could expect were at the   (public transportation) for my ticket, but not for an ID"
203712,715,primary,468,"    They also told me German citizens by law are required to carry a national ID card, but no one I know had ever been stopped and asked for it, except at the borders and on the train or at the airport. I was told I shouldnâ€™t carry my passport at all times, especially because I might lose it. No one ever mentioned that I could get stopped while running in the park. And when I told these friends about my encounter with the police officer while running, they assured me it was a   event. No one thought I would continue to get stopped. Iâ€™ve had my ID checked by the police 23 times in the nine months Iâ€™ve lived in Berlin Nine months and 23 identification checks later, Iâ€™m tired of getting asked where Iâ€™m from and where my ID is. Iâ€™m annoyed by the grocery store security guard asking me if Iâ€™m going to purchase the things I have in my cart whenever I stop in the store to think about what else I am forgetting on my list. Iâ€™m annoyed by the police officer who picks me out of my group of white friends and asks for my ID. Iâ€™m annoyed by the police officer who asks me where Iâ€™m going on a Sunday morning walk to the park and asks to see my ID"
203712,716,primary,475,"These stops have made me question what people see when they look at me. Getting humiliated on the street by authorities has shown me that for some people, Iâ€™m just another â€œbrownâ€ person who could be a terrorist or a criminal. When I show the police officers my passport, they always seem surprised that Iâ€™m from the US and not from India because of my skin color and appearance. Itâ€™s not only insulting, but it also shows me that their image of what an American person could look like is narrow. I understand that for many people, I might be the first person of color theyâ€™ve ever met or seen, but this does not give anyone the right to question my nationality or assume Iâ€™m a criminal. At the beginning I felt ostracized by these encounters, but Iâ€™m sad to say Iâ€™ve gotten so used to it that I feel despondent. I want to know what can be done to help these officers understand that each time they stop me or another person of color, they are reinforcing the stereotypes we all deal with on a daily basis"
203712,717,tertiary,563,"What also worries me is the message this sends to the refugees who have been for the most part welcomed into Germany with open arms. It makes me wonder about how many others are getting stopped and how they are dealing with it. If I feel this angered and hopeless, I canâ€™t imagine what someone who seeks asylum is feeling, especially when they thought they were going to be in a safe place that gave them more respect but instead are singled out for the color of their skin"
203712,718,primary,959,"My experience with the German police has also made me reassess my attitude toward their role of making sure the country is safe. I donâ€™t really know what my rights are living in Germany and what I can and canâ€™t be asked for. Itâ€™s also more difficult for me to answer questions from authorities because I donâ€™t speak German. And because Iâ€™ve been stopped for identification so many times and feel targeted, it makes me question if Iâ€™m really truly safe. I understand that they might find the suspect for a crime during these ID checks, but itâ€™s hard for me to wrap my head around how people of color can truly trust the police here when they are so often seen as terrorists or criminals"
203712,719,secondary,109,    This experience has helped me empathize and think a lot about how people of color in the US feel when the police target them. I know plenty of people of color whoâ€™ve lost trust in the police and donâ€™t know whom to turn to when they witness or are a victim of an actual crime. This is exactly how I feel in Germany. I donâ€™t know if I would trust the police here to believe me when there is a crime happening because some of them have made me feel as if Iâ€™m a criminal already
203712,720,primary,34,"Getting my ID checked so often makes me question myself I talked to my colleagues at Correctiv  â€”   mostly white men  â€”   about these ID checks. All of them but one, a Syrian refugee, were shocked. They urged me to tell my story, but at first I was skeptical. They also urged me to request any information the police had recorded on me, because if I was going to tell this story there would be a lot of people coming forward saying this was impossible since they had never experienced such a thing"
203712,721,primary,253," I spoke to my fellowship,   OpenNews, and they were shocked as well. They had never heard of such a thing happening before  â€”   theyâ€™d had two fellows in Berlin previously, but the prior fellows werenâ€™t people of color. They urged me to seek out groups to talk to that might have experience with ID checks"
203712,722,secondary,83,"When I reached out to a few people of color I knew in Berlin, they were surprised, but not for the same reason my colleagues and fellowship were. It was because Iâ€™m a woman. Normally, they said, these identification checks happen to men of color, especially black men, who are presumed to be drug dealers by the police"
203712,723,secondary,278,"Each time I get checked, I question what Iâ€™m wearing or if Iâ€™m doing something I shouldnâ€™t be doing. Why me? And each time, I know I shouldnâ€™t ask myself these questions, because I know it clearly has nothing to do with either of those things. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I have a copy of my ID folded so small, it fits in my running clothes so that I have it in case I get stopped"
203712,724,secondary,886,"My life in the United States  Iâ€™m a   Indian American. I grew up in a diverse township in New Jersey. I never thought about people singling me out for my skin color or family background. I had my fair share of getting made fun of, especially because I was what they called a â€œgeek. â€ I got made fun of for wearing glasses, called â€œfour eyes,â€ for always having braids in my hair, and for having â€œweirdâ€ food like idlis for lunch. Looking back, I was naive in thinking that these comments werenâ€™t targeted toward my family background. I didnâ€™t think much about why people said the things they did to me"

Even worse: The person said this in front of other people, which only reinforced the idea that people of color donâ€™t belong on television. It made me hesitant to want to continue to work toward a goal of being on national TV as a reporter one day. This person also suggested if I wanted to continue doing TV, I should consider shortening my name and getting a name that was â€œeasier to pronounce. â€ That was a punch in the gut and made me want to quit journalism"

Soon, I felt bad for them because they didnâ€™t know anything else but their small bubble of white people"
203712,729,tertiary,369,The color of my skin was speaking for me. It didnâ€™t matter that I am a US citizen. It was the fact I had a strange name that they choked on to pronounce and prompted them to ask if I had a nickname.

203712,730,tertiary,632," So living in Germany, I wasnâ€™t completely outraged by the racism, since Iâ€™ve experienced different types before. Iâ€™ve been trying to pinpoint why I feel ostracized in a different way when I hear racist remarks in the US versus my experience here in Germany. In the US, I just feel bad for people who arenâ€™t educated enough to know what the difference between â€œHindiâ€ and â€œHinduâ€ is and how stupid they sound when they say I donâ€™t belong. Their statements are harsh, but I know they are not true and I can dismiss them"
203712,731,secondary,150,"   In Germany, there are no statements made toward me. Itâ€™s just a few questions that make me feel invalidated. Both are ways of people making someone else feel like an outsider, but the questioning makes me feel as if there are more fingers pointed at me. If it were questions from ignorant everyday people, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be as bothered. Itâ€™s because this uncertainty is coming from authority figures (like the police) that society tells us to trust and respect. When they are uncertain about me, Iâ€™m uncertain about their role to keep people safe and feel like Iâ€™m accused of doing something wrong since the questions are so short and accusatory"
203712,732,secondary,290,"How big a problem is racial profiling in Germany? The third time I got checked, I asked myself: What data are they collecting, and how many other people are having this happen? I canâ€™t just let myself be angry about these checks. I know it canâ€™t just be me. As a journalist, it bothers me that others may be getting hurt in the same way and may not have the experience dealing with racism before. Germans are very private people and are very cautious about giving out personal information. There is a form anyone can fill out to request the information authorities are storing about them. Curious to see what the police department had on me, I sent in a request and got a note back stating they had no information on me. So why was it that the police officers had a notebook and seemed to be writing down something when they asked me questions?  I followed up this records request to the Berlin police department, who responded saying they donâ€™t racially profile anyone because thatâ€™s illegal  â€”   and they donâ€™t do illegal things. The police said it only collects information on raids in the   â€œdanger zones. â€ These danger zones are designated areas the police frequently visit because of high crimes. I also asked for the location of these danger zones. They told me getting this information would be harmful to the police security practices"
203712,733,tertiary,107,"I also talked with more than a dozen people of color whoâ€™ve also experienced identification checks from the police. I met many of these people through racial profiling advocacy organizations and through friends of friends. A few of the refugees I spoke to told me they felt ostracized coming to a country where they thought theyâ€™d be accepted and instead feel as if they donâ€™t belong. They too questioned whether they were wearing something inappropriate or walking on a street they werenâ€™t supposed to. Another man with two young children told me he was stopped and asked if those were his children. His children are mixed black and white and looked, according to the police, â€œmore â€˜whiteâ€™ than â€˜black. â€™â€ When I sat down with the Berlin police spokesperson, Thomas Neuendorf, he said he was shocked that Iâ€™d been stopped so many times. He said the checks I had experienced could be seen as illegal, since police officers only perform checks on areas where there is a suspicion of crime. He went on to assure me the police only do checks on â€œpeople who look suspiciousâ€ because the person fits a profile of someone they are already looking for"
203712,734,primary,509,"   He said the police wouldnâ€™t search a â€œblond,   person. â€ He added that the police force has several people of migrant backgrounds and has intercultural competence trainings to prevent racial profiling from happening. But, he said, training is different from the reality of being a police officer, so they canâ€™t help if someone turns out to be racist despite all the trainings. He apologized on behalf of the department for what Iâ€™d experienced. Hearing the words â€œ  personâ€ alarmed me. This is the root of the problem. Who comes up with the definition of who looks German or Australian or American or Indian? When are we going to move past this and realize that a personâ€™s skin color does not define their nationality? I also wondered what goes in the intercultural trainings the officers went through. I asked Neuendorf about the words â€œ  person,â€ and he said heâ€™d used the wrong words and that phrase isnâ€™t what he actually meant"
203712,735,tertiary,206," Still, I know that the dozen people I spoke to are only a small fraction of the number of people experiencing racial profiling in Germany and in Europe. I spoke to the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance as well as other organizations that have been researching this issue for a while. And I know this answer Iâ€™ve gotten from the Berlin police is not acceptable"
203712,736,primary,338,"This experience made me see how authority figures can reinforce damaging stereotypes Iâ€™m not the only one asking questions. In August, a member of the state parliament in Berlin asked about how the police are handling racial profiling, citing research from Commission Against Racism and Intolerance as well as the United Nations, which had a report on institutional racism by law enforcement in Germany. Similar to what I was told from the police, he was also told the German police departments donâ€™t racially profile"

I empathize with those who feel lost because of accusations and targeting from authority figures. My hope is that by raising awareness about these issues, more people will come forward and tell their story and show people that what they are doing is not acceptable.

179771,742,primary,122," The U. S. Senate on Thursday voted narrowly to repeal regulations requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customersâ€™ privacy than websites like Alphabet Incâ€™s Google ( ) or Facebook Inc ( ). The vote was along party lines, with 50 Republicans approving the measure and 48 Democrats rejecting it. The two remaining Republicans in the Senate were absent and did not cast a vote. According to the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under   Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, childrenâ€™s information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. The vote was a victory for internet providers such as AT&T Inc ( ) Comcast Corp ( ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( ) which had strongly opposed the rules. The bill next goes to the U. S. House of Representatives, but it was not clear when they would take up the measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that â€makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment.â€ But Democratic Senator Ed Markey said, â€Republicans have just made it easier for Americanâ€™s sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission.â€ FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. In a joint statement, Democratic members of the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission said the Senate vote â€creates a massive gap in consumer protection law as broadband and cable companies now have no discernible privacy requirements.â€ Republican commissioners, including Pai, said in October that the rules would unfairly give websites like Facebook, Twitter Inc ( ) or Google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus dominate digital advertising. The FCC earlier this month delayed the data rules from taking effect. The Internet and Television Association, a trade group, in a statement praised the vote as a â€critical step towards   a balanced framework that is grounded in the   and successful FTC privacy framework that applies equally to all parties operating online.â€ Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for advocacy group Consumers Union, said the vote â€is a huge step in the wrong direction, and it completely ignores the needs and concerns of consumers.â€  (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chris Reese and Jonathan Oatis) FRANKFURT German auto supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.

160747,743,tertiary,564,"Rex Tillerson,   Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for U. S. secretary of state, is severing his ties with Exxon Mobil. The former chairman and CEO is in line to receive a $180 million retirement package. Tillerson, who has spent his entire career at Exxon, would have reached mandatory retirement age in March. The company announced that it will pay him in cash for the more than 2 million shares he would have received over the next 10 years and that the money will be transferred to an independently managed trust. If confirmed as secretary of state, Tillerson also has committed to sell the more than 600, 000 Exxon shares he currently owns. The deal means he will give up about $7 million dollars, compared with what he would have received had he retired in March as planned. The deal was worked out to comply with federal ethics rules. Tillerson has promised not to return to the oil and gas industry for 10 years. If he violates the agreement, he would forfeit all the money in the trust, which would be given away to charities chosen by the trust manager. All this is meant to reassure senators that Tillerson would not be unduly influenced by Exxon Mobil if he were to become Americaâ€™s top diplomat. He still has an uphill battle for confirmation. Democrats have yet to agree on confirmation hearings tentatively set for Jan. 11, and senators on both sides of the aisle will likely question Tillerson about his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Exxon Mobil CEO, he was opposed to U. S. sanctions on Russia, which got in the way of his companyâ€™s project with Russian energy company Rosneft to drill in the Arctic. Tillerson met Wednesday with the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin, who has been an outspoken critic of Russia and a supporter of sanctions.

212254,745,secondary,305,"       On Tuesday, WaPoâ€™s Dave Fahrenthold got to the bottom of one of the big mysteries of Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign: Did he really raise and donate $6 million  â€”   including $1 million of his own money  â€”   to veteransâ€™ organizations as he had boasted for months?  I was fascinated by how Fahrenthold harnessed the power of social media to finally pin down Trump and get some answers. I reached out to Dave to pick his brain about why the story initially interested him and how and when he decided to take his reporting to Twitter. Our conversation, conducted via email and edited only for grammar, is below. Explain your thought process when you decided to take on the Trump veterans donation claim. What drew you to it? Iâ€™d seen Trump give away oversized checks to vetsâ€™ groups in Iowa  â€”   and then stop giving them away in New Hampshire, with much of the money still unaccounted for. I decided to see if I could find out what happened to the rest of it. I liked this story idea because it was so concrete. There was no need for speculation: â€œCould Trump really build the wall? Experts say   â€¦    â€). There was a specific claim  â€”   Trump had raised $6 million, and he was giving it away. And there were people outside Trumpâ€™s campaign (the vetsâ€™ charities) who could say whether that claim was actually coming true. I started this as a side project in February, making a few calls to the charities Trump had listed as recipients. At that point, I figured it would most likely be a wild goose chase. Iâ€™d find out that the charities had all already received big donations from Trump, and that would be that. Because who stiffs military veterans in the middle of a presidential campaign?  But then, the first ones I called said they hadnâ€™t actually received anything yet from Trump. That got me started on whatâ€™s now been a few months of reporting"
212254,746,tertiary,32,"   This woman really likes Donald Trump. (Jabin   Washington Post)  You used Twitter to report the story out. Why? And what was the result? By this week, I thought I had a good handle on one part of this story: what became of the donations that other donors gave to Trumpâ€™s effort. We knew that at least $4. 5 million had been raised, and $3. 1 million had been given away so far. The piece that was missing was the $1 million that Trump said heâ€™d given himself. His campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, told me Trump had given the money away. But to who? Lewandowski wouldnâ€™t say"
212254,747,secondary,390,"I had doubts: Would Donald Trump, of all people, really give away $1 million in secret? But that left me trying to prove a negative. I could try to call every veteransâ€™ charity in the U. S. and ask them all individually if theyâ€™d received money from Trump. But even if I reached 1, 000 charities, what if Trump had given his money to number 1, 001? I decided to make my search public, using Twitter to reach out to prominent veteransâ€™ groups, vets advocates and news sites aimed at veterans and   military. I asked whether any of them had received even $1 from Trumpâ€™s supposed   gift. I used Trumpâ€™s Twitter handle in my queries so they would show up in Trumpâ€™s own mentions. I wanted Trump to feel scrutiny on his preferred   platform in the hope that he would reach out to answer the question himself. Apparently, he noticed. That night, Trump sent several tweets attacking the media for its coverage of his fundraiser. And  â€”   at some point that evening  â€”   he actually made a call and gave his $1 million gift, almost four months late"
212254,748,secondary,349," Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media"
212254,749,primary,68,"â€”   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 24, 2016  When did you realize that Trump hadnâ€™t actually made the donation he said he made? Not until Trump called me on Tuesday afternoon to say heâ€™d just given the whole million at once. Until then, I hadnâ€™t found proof of any gift of personal cash from Trump to a vetsâ€™ group. But of course, I also hadnâ€™t been able to prove the negative: that such a gift definitely didnâ€™t exist. How did you get Trump on the phone? At what point in the story did it happen? We had put in a request to talk with Trump on Tuesday, after heâ€™d sent out those tweets and an Instagram message criticizing our reporting. But to be honest, I didnâ€™t think he would call: In the past, my questions about the vets fundraising have been answered by Trumpâ€™s staffers, not the candidate himself. But then, about 5 p. m. he did call from his plane. We had to scrap our old plan for that dayâ€™s story, which had been mainly focused on Trumpâ€™s attacks on the media. After I got off the phone with Trump, I called the foundation heâ€™d given to and got confirmation that the $1 million had truly been promised to them. Then we quickly wrote up a story for the Web. This was a story you used social media to execute. Whatâ€™s been the response on Twitter and the like once the story landed? I was really grateful that many other reporters  â€”   including many who donâ€™t even cover politics  â€”   retweeted my queries seeking answers about Trumpâ€™s $1 million on Monday. Iâ€™m not much of a   expert, and my Twitter following is pretty measly. I got a lot of help from Post colleagues with bigger followings, of course. But I also got a huge boost from people like Matt Pearce at the L. A. Times and Sopan Deb at CBS (whom I offered to buy dinner if he could find me somebody who got Trumpâ€™s money). They amplified my questions, helped me reach a far larger audience than I could have on my own. It was wonderful to get that kind of vital help from people who are theoretically my competitors. Since the story landed, the reception has been incredibly gracious. And I am glad that I donâ€™t have to buy Sopan dinner after all."
166195,750,tertiary,399,"There will be a question from some about Texas Sen. Ted Cruzâ€™s eligibility to run for president. Thatâ€™s because even though Cruz grew up in Texas, he was born in Canada. (He renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2013.) Democrats are sure to remind voters of Cruzâ€™s Canadian birth since some on the right have questioned where President Obama was born. The president is a native of Hawaii. The U. S. Constitution says presidential candidates have to be â€  citizens.â€ But the Supreme Court has never weighed in with a definition, leaving it open to interpretation. Itâ€™s a question that has come up before. In 2008, senators passed a resolution, making it clear, for example, that John McCain was allowed to run given that he was born on a U. S. military base in the Panama Canal Zone. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, both senators then, voted for it. Barry Goldwater, the 1964 GOP nominee, was born in Arizona when it was a territory  â€”   not a state. And some questioned George Romneyâ€™s eligibility to run in 1968, because he was born in Mexico. Romneyâ€™s parents were U. S. residents. Cruzâ€™s parents worked in the oil industry in Calgary, Canada, when he was born. His mother was born in the United States. His father was born in Cuba, but later became a U. S. resident. Cruz argues that because his mother was born in Delaware, he is, in fact, a â€  citizen.â€ And most legal scholars agree. In fact, two of the   Supreme Court lawyers  â€”   who are not normally on the same side  â€”   make the case that Cruz, as were McCain, George Romney and Goldwater, is eligible to run. Neal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, and Paul Clement, who was solicitor general under George W. Bush, wrote earlier this month in the Harvard Law Review that â€there is no questionâ€ Cruz is eligible. They say that because Cruzâ€™s mother was a U. S. citizen and his father was a U. S. resident, â€Cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a â€™natural born Citizenâ€™ within the meaning of the Constitutionâ€ and the â€Naturalization Act of 1790.â€ They also point to British common law and enactments by the First Congress, both of which have been cited by the Supreme Court. â€Both confirm that the original meaning of the phrase â€™natural born Citizenâ€™ includes persons born abroad who are citizens from birth based on the citizenship of a parent. As to the British practice, laws in force in the 1700s recognized that children born outside of the British Empire to subjects of the Crown were subjects themselves and explicitly used â€™natural bornâ€™ to encompass such children. These statutes provided that children born abroad to subjects of the British Empire were â€™  Subjects . .. to all Intents, Constructions, and Purposes whatsoever.â€™ â€The Framers, of course, would have been intimately familiar with these statutes and the way they used terms like â€™natural born,â€™ since the statutes were binding law in the colonies before the Revolutionary War. They were also well documented in Blackstoneâ€™s Commentaries, a text widely circulated and read by the Framers and routinely invoked in interpreting the Constitution. â€No doubt informed by this longstanding tradition, just three years after the drafting of the Constitution, the First Congress established that children born abroad to U. S. citizens were U. S. citizens at birth, and explicitly recognized that such children were â€™natural born Citizens.â€™ The Naturalization Act of 1790 provided that â€™the children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born citizens: Provided, That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States. . ..â€™ â€The actions and understandings of the First Congress are particularly persuasive because so many of the Framers of the Constitution were also members of the First Congress. That is particularly true in this instance, as eight of the eleven members of the committee that proposed the natural born eligibility requirement to the Convention served in the First Congress and none objected to a definition of â€™natural born Citizenâ€™ that included persons born abroad to citizen parents.â€ Katyal and Clement conclude, â€There are plenty of serious issues to debate in the upcoming presidential election cycle. The less time spent dealing with specious objections to candidate eligibility, the better. Fortunately, the Constitution is refreshingly clear on these eligibility issues.â€"
170910,751,secondary,101,"In a year when the topic seems virtually unavoidable, race has been a major focus of coverage of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. There was the MSNBC panel Monday evening in which Iowa Rep. Steve King questioned whether nonwhites have made any contributions to civilization. There was the speech in which Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. who is black, shouted â€Blue lives matter!â€ and equated the Black Lives Matter movement with anarchy. There was the viral hashtag #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes, inspired by accusations of plagiarism directed at the Republican presidential nomineeâ€™s wife, whose speech included notable similarities to remarks Michelle Obama gave in 2008. Satirists using the hashtag had Melania Trump saying things like, â€I have a dream!â€ and â€Say it loud! Iâ€™m black and Iâ€™m proud!â€ drawing attention to the fact that a white woman was being accused of stealing from a black woman. (On Wednesday, Trump Organization employee Meredith McIver took responsibility for the remarks, saying Melania Trump â€always likedâ€ Michelle Obama and, while preparing her speech, had read passages from the 2008 speech to McIver, who says she wrote them down and later included them in Mrs. Trumpâ€™s speech.) All this as the Republican Party faces scrutiny over diversity  â€”   or lack of it  â€”   in its ranks. The party sent fewer black delegates to this convention than at any point in the past century, according to The Washington Post: 18 black folks out of 2, 472 total delegates. Hereâ€™s more from the Post: â€This yearâ€™s gathering will almost certainly rank among the bottom tier. The 2008 convention had the   density of black delegates, excluding 2016, trumped only by the 1964 convening that nominated Barry Goldwater. That was the year after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, one of the precipitating events that moves black Americans firmly into the Democratic camp. â€A poll from Quinnipiac University earlier this month showed Trump earning 1 percent of the black vote nationally. NBC   Street Journal polling in Ohio and Pennsylvania had worse news: In those states, Trumpâ€™s share of the black vote was at zero.â€ The New York Times reported on a sense of fatigue expressed by some black Republicans at the convention. Day One, the article notes, was seen by some as a â€white national convention lecturing   about the police and race relations.â€ â€Mike Hill, a black Republican state representative in Florida, grew steadily more disheartened as he watched television clips of his partyâ€™s overwhelmingly white national convention lecturing   about the police and race relations. â€There was Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, nearly shouting Monday night that the police only wanted to help people, regardless of race. A sea of white convention delegates, cheering wildly as two black speakers ridiculed the Black Lives Matter movement and unconditionally praised law enforcement officers. And a series of speakers pushing Donald J. Trumpâ€™s    message and arguing, as he has, that the United States had lost its way. â€ â€™When a lot of white Republicans get together and bring up race, even telling black people how they should see police and the world, it evokes the worst kind of emotion,â€™ said Mr. Hill, who supports Mr. Trump but decided to skip the convention. â€™We have so few black Republicans to begin with. Talking about race wonâ€™t bring us more.â€™ â€ This fatigue was mirrored in a â€letter of concernâ€ that minority Republicans wrote in response to the overwhelming whiteness of the convention. The letter, addressed to RNC Chairperson Reince Priebus, calls attention to â€deficitsâ€ in the partyâ€™s outreach to more diverse communities, and problems those deficits could create for the party. Hereâ€™s part of the letter: â€This deficit allows the perception of a willful or often intentional   of multicultural inclusion within the Republican Party structure. â€We have watched in dismay as the presumptive nominee of our Party, the Party of Abraham Lincoln, has caused massive defection, disgust, and disinterest with comments and behaviors that are offensive to the very demographics we need to win this election. â€The unfortunate reality of the points expressed above is more readily and recently evidenced by the unexplained exodus of Black and Hispanic staffers at the RNC headquarters.â€ At Fusion, Collier Meyerson wrote about Melania Trumpâ€™s speech, saying this â€apparent plagiarismâ€ shouldnâ€™t be written off as a â€silly mistake,â€ and that itâ€™s important to consider the context in which Michelle Obamaâ€™s similar words and phrases were originally delivered: â€The words were not only an insight into the Obama coupleâ€™s shared values, but a way to make their skin color more palatable to skeptical white voters. Michelle drew on themes that are, unfortunately, not often associated with black America by white America: that being honest is paramount, that working hard is a must, and that she and her husband take serious stock in the American dream  â€”   a dream that has largely excluded black Americans. They were important words for a black woman, specifically, to say on national television.â€ Itâ€™s worth noting that people of color have taken a stage at the RNC. There was also Sajid Tarar, a Pakistani Muslim immigrant who led a prayer for Donald Trump at the close of the second day. In an interview with Fusion, Tarar explains his rationale behind supporting Trump: â€In American politics, we like to use identity as shorthand: Itâ€™s easy to conceptualize the â€™Muslim voteâ€™ as a monolithic bloc. But as Tarar makes clear, voters are far more complicated than any single identity. Heâ€™s Muslim, but heâ€™s also conservative and pissed off at the establishment and worried about terrorism. â€ â€™This is my country and this is my kidsâ€™ country. That is my number one priority, the safety of America,â€™ Tarar said. â€™Donald Trump agrees with that.â€™ â€ On Day Two of the convention, Harmeet Dhillon, a Sikh American woman who formerly chaired the Republican Party of San Francisco, opened the convention day with a Sikh prayer. Her head was covered with a scarf, and she sang the invocation in Punjabi before translating it into English as white audience members bowed their heads. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. a black Democrat, also addressed the mostly white crowd at the convention, saying in his speech that race is a â€heated issueâ€ in the United States. He talked about the shooting deaths of three police officers in Baton Rouge and the acquittal of an officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, which he called â€good news.â€ â€What we witnessed in Ferguson, in Baltimore and Baton Rouge was a collapse of the social order,â€ said Clarke in his speech. â€So many of the actions of the Occupy Movement and Black Lives Matter transcends peaceful protest and violates the code of conduct we rely on. I call it anarchy.â€ The Washington Postâ€™s Janell Ross wrote about why someone like Clarke  â€”   again, technically a Democrat  â€”   might get invited to speak at the RNC. He was appointed to his current position by the   of Wisconsin, a Republican. Part of what made Clarke a â€kind of Milwaukee attraction,â€ Ross writes, was a sense that he was â€one of those elected officials able to draw large crowds, appeal to people across party lines and say things that no white politician, certainly no white Republican would without some kind of blowback in the very politically blue, nearly   black Milwaukee area.â€ Ross talked with political scientist Juliet Hooker about this, and hereâ€™s some of what Hooker had to say: â€The appeal of a black conservative like Clarke is that their views disrupt what I call racialized solidarity . .. (i. e. that blacks and whites tend to have different views of the same events, as has been largely true of Black Lives Matter even with all the videos showing police escalation, culpability, etc. ). â€This allows the critique of BLM [Black Lives Matter] to become an issue that Republicans can say is about ideology, not racism. Clarke himself does this when he talks about liberals not being willing to call them a hate group, etc. â€This narrative also fits in with the Republican baseâ€™s feeling that racism against whites is a problem that is not being acknowledged and that is stronger than   racism.â€ Meanwhile, Iowa Rep. Steve Kingâ€™s remarks on the MSNBC panel  â€”   â€Iâ€™d ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that youâ€™re talking about. Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?â€  â€”   inspired the hashtag #LessRacistThanSteveKing. Quartz responded cheekily to Kingâ€™s remarks with a post titled â€Dear Steve King: Here are some things not invented by white people.â€ The list includes everything from mathematics and the seismograph to Pokemon and irrigation, and concludes with this statement: â€By defending white peopleâ€™s contributions to civilization, King is only carrying out one of their most longstanding ones  â€”   discounting the contributions of everyone else.â€ On Wednesday, King offered further comment on his earlier remarks to Politico, saying he felt one of his   was â€disparaging a group of peopleâ€ in saying the Republican Party wonâ€™t be led by â€old white peopleâ€ in the future. â€If youâ€™re sitting here as a seated member of Congress on a national television show and asked to swallow something like that and curl up, again, no other group of people would take that,â€ King said. He also elaborated on his remarks about history: â€Offering a further explanation, King said he pointed out â€™that Western civilization is the most successful civilization the world has ever seen,â€™ and the foundation of the United Statesâ€™ â€™ideological thought is rooted in the Enlightenment in Europe, and then this country was born at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, with that thought process and that coming over here to this country, like a giant Petri dish that was created for America to burst up onto the scene in the world. And we did a lot with that . .. â€ â€™The sum total thatâ€™s been contributed by Western civilization, it surpasses any other culture or civilization, partly because we borrowed from them along the way, and weâ€™re flexible enough to do that. And so I donâ€™t think we should apologize for our success. And the idea of multiculturalism, in that every culture is equal  â€”   thatâ€™s not objectively true. And weâ€™ve been fed that information for the last 25 years in this country, and weâ€™re not going to continue to become a greater nation if we donâ€™t look at this objectively.â€™ â€ This isnâ€™t a complete list of   happenings at the RNC, and let us remind you that this is just the beginning of convention season. We still have a long way to go, and the Democratic National Convention hasnâ€™t even started yet. With that in mind, we anticipate a sequel to this post in the    future.

206592,752,primary,385," President Trump found himself in unfamiliar territory Friday, generally praised by members of the political and foreign policy establishments but attacked from some quarters of Trump nation for seeming to betray the â€œAmerica Firstâ€ pledges that carried him to the White House. Trumpâ€™s decision to fire cruise missiles at a Syrian air base in response to Tuesdayâ€™s chemical weapons attack against civilians won support from some people he had routinely disparaged over the past year, among them Sen. John McCain ( .) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.). Hours before the U. S. attacks, Hillary Clinton had urged just such a response. But some Trump loyalists saw the president as taking a potentially fateful turn away from what had made him so attractive to his     supporters. Radio talk show host Laura Ingraham tweeted, â€œMissiles flying. [Florida Sen. Marco] Rubioâ€™s happy. McCainâ€™s ecstatic. Hillaryâ€™s on board. A complete policy change in 48 hours. â€ Farther out on the nationalist fringe, Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at Infowars. com, tweeted, â€œItâ€™s been fun, lads, but the fun is over. â€ Watson clarified that he was not turning on Trump completely but was off the train with regard to Syria. There was always a contradiction in Trumpâ€™s campaign rhetoric on foreign policy. He was the   leader who would â€œbomb the hell out of ISISâ€ and portrayed himself as a dramatic contrast to what he called the weak and ineffective leadership of Barack Obama. But he was also the reluctant interventionist and criticized rivals who advocated deeper military involvement in Syria. In his speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump promised to be president of this country, not the rest of the world. On Thursday night, Trump ended his address announcing the missile strike with the traditional â€œGod bless America,â€ and then, after a brief pause, â€œand the entire world. â€      (Louisa Loveluck, Jason   Washington Post)   What the U. S. strike reveals about the presidentâ€™s foreign policy remains unclear. Was this a   action, meant only to tell Syrian President Bashar    not to use chemical weapons again? Or could the strike lead to deeper U. S. involvement in Syria, depending on reactions by the Syrian regime, Russia, Iran or Islamic State forces?   Trumpâ€™s sharp turn in a matter of days was so dramatic and unexpected that it produced whiplash among many foreign policy experts. That he could pivot so quickly is a reminder that Trump is a president without a deeply rooted national security philosophy or worldview, someone who was decisively swayed by the terrible images of dead and dying children that were broadcast around the world after the chemical attack"
206592,753,primary,859,"[Trump officials say strikes were in national interest]  Obama had drawn a famous â€œred lineâ€ in Syria in 2012, warning Assad against the use of chemical weapons. His failure to take military action after Syria launched a chemical attack in the summer of 2013 marked one of his greatest foreign policy failures and became a symbol of presidential equivocation and weakness. Notably, Trump was not among those criticizing Obama at the time. Instead, he warned Obama not to take military action, even when chemical weapons had been used. This week, the chemical attack gave Trump an early opportunity to draw a distinction from his predecessor, even if it contradicted the view he stated in 2013. Among Trump loyalists who had been sharply critical of Obama on this and other issues, the new presidentâ€™s decision to attack was welcomed as a sign of how significantly things have changed. Conservative talk show host Bill Mitchell tweeted that Trumpâ€™s action â€œobliterated Obamaâ€™s eight years of [weakness] in one bold stroke. â€      (Jayne   Washington Post)   But the nervousness within Trumpâ€™s coalition was also evident, even among those who did not offer outright criticism. Nigel Farage, the former leader of Britainâ€™s UK Independence Party and a Trump ally, expressed qualms about what the missile strikes might foretell. â€œMany Trump voters will be worried about this intervention,â€ he tweeted. â€œWhere will it end?â€ Tom Donilon, who was national security adviser in the Obama administration, described the retaliatory strike as â€œlimited and appropriateâ€ and said Trump and his advisers should make it clear that this was about the use of chemical weapons only and not a broader indication of U. S. policy. But he also said Trumpâ€™s team must now decide on concrete goals for their Syrian policy. â€œThatâ€™s up to the president to make that clear to his military leaders,â€ he said. Jake Sullivan, an Obama administration official who was Clintonâ€™s policy adviser during the campaign, said he was struck that Trump, in his statement Thursday night, went beyond the issue of chemical weapons and called on other nations to join the United States to help end â€œthe slaughter and bloodshed in Syria. â€ That, too, marked a big departure from the campaign. â€œThose are big questions that require thoughtful and considered responses, and Iâ€™m hopeful that the team around him will deliver those,â€ Sullivan said, agreeing that the United States should help lead that effort. â€œSo far, we just havenâ€™t seen or heard from Trump anything to suggest how the United States could get involved. â€  [Questions left in the wake of Trumpâ€™s decision to hit Syria]  The president is shaped and influenced by what he sees on television. After viewing the horrendous images of suffering and death from the chemical attack, Trump said he had changed his view of Assad  â€”   even though similar images existed from the Syrian regimeâ€™s chemical attack in 2013. It seemed as if the reality of being president had settled in on him in unexpected ways. How might he react if confronted by other horrible cases of   civilian casualties inflicted by Assad? Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said   reactions to the presidentâ€™s action are likely to focus on his decisiveness rather than the implications for his Syria policy. â€œBut those reactions will be good for about a week, and then after that it really depends on how events unfold in Syria,â€ Garin said. â€œVoters generally and Trump voters specifically are not eager for a sustained military engagement in Syria. And if the bombing turns out to have produced no apparent result, or draws the U. S. into a more complicated situation, the possibility for blowback against Trump is significant. â€ Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said Trump might be able to bring along his loyalists, even if he takes additional military steps in the Middle East. â€œIf he frames it as a clear effort to promote and protect American interests in a compelling way, then I think a lot of his supporters will follow along,â€ Ayres said. â€œBut he needs to have a compelling rationale and explain it clearly. â€ Amid the statements of support Friday, some members of Congress asked Trump to seek new congressional authority for use of military force in the Middle East, though when Obama sought that in 2013, he met strong resistance on Capitol Hill. There was no sign that Trump is prepared to do that, but U. N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United States was â€œprepared to do moreâ€ in Syria, leaving open the question of a future role for Congress. That would put the president in a more difficult place politically, not only with the nationalists in his base, who overwhelmingly oppose such a step, but with the broader public. â€œIf there is a debate about authorization of military force, that starts to change the complexion because it does begin to look like a big,   commitment to military forces operating in the Middle East,â€ said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. â€œThat is not what people want. â€ "

Every designer here seems to be trying to find a way to speak directly and intimately to the consumer. What do shoppers want? What do women want? Some designers are trying to speak to the logistics of consumption. Others are grappling with bigger, more existential concerns, such as the role fashion plays in the midst of fractured politics, social upheaval and debates about our ability  â€”   and desire  â€”   to be inclusive, not just in fashion, but in the broader cultural dialogue. In short, fashion is having a crisis of communication, one that is terribly familiar: How do we talk to each other?    Natasha Lyonne at the Opening Ceremony political pageant and presentation of the fall 2016 collection. (Kate Warren for The Washington Post)  With no clear answer in sight, the first few days of Fashion Week have been a bit like the tower of Babel. Everyone is speaking with their own distinct vocabulary. No singular message is coming through. For example, which season is on the runway? It depends on who the designer is. Minkoff sent her fall 2016 collection down an outdoor runway on a day that was so hot and steamy that just the action of breathing was enough to make you break into a dripping sweat. The models  â€”   both professional and amateur  â€”   were dressed in wool overcoats trimmed in fur, leather jackets emblazoned with slogans about love and peace, cozy sweaters and a thin layer of perspiration. Hilfiger put his collaboration with model Gigi Hadid  â€”   a collection featuring leather jackets with military flourishes,   sweaters with giant logos and wool capelets  â€”   on his carnival midway. It was also part of the     craze, which is splendid news for those customers motivated to buy   sweaters and fleece hoodies on a night so humid that one could actually see the air. But pity the models who had to strut from one end of Pier 16 at the South Street Seaport to the other. Hiking the Sahara might have been more comfortable. But the consumer must be appeased"

(Kate Warren for The Washington Post)  Is this what they want? After Minkoffâ€™s first   show six months ago, the company reported having one of its biggest sales days ever. So who knows what might end up on the runway this September: cotton shirting or cashmere sweaters? Slip dresses or   overcoats? In some ways, designers are not simply looking to make a quick sale, wonderful as that might be. Theyâ€™re also attempting to build a relationship with customers. They are aiming to create a sense of empathy and goodwill, emotions that would, perhaps, sustain them through tough times. And so there are designers such as Kerby   of Pyer Moss, who found his inspiration in the tension between capitalism and income inequality. The designers at Tome looked at the work of feminist writer Germaine Greer. And Prabal Gurung was moved by the career of Gloria Steinem and her memoir, â€œMy Life on the Road. â€    Tome, spring 2017.

He has brought a renewed vigor to the house, retaining its signature bold femininity with colorful botanical prints and antique kimono patterns, but giving the collection a jolt of sleek tailoring and a bit more of a modern, urban edge with dresses covered in micro paillettes that look like liquid silver"

She is a very modern woman. â€ And modern women do not want to have to pay thousands of dollars to get a dress that fits well, looks good and makes them smile"

(Kate Warren for The Washington Post)  As designers think about the demands in a womanâ€™s life, they are also, by default, contemplating our current politics. They have been inspired to strive for clothes that speak to a more accomplished woman, a more diverse group of women and a generation of women who embrace fashion not just as clothes but as a tool for social change"

215182,769,tertiary,407,"  Opening Ceremony, fall 2016. (Kate Warren for The Washington Post)  Fashion and politics are an unlikely couple, but both are about â€œthe ability to express oneâ€™s identity freely,â€ said the designers in their show notes. A similar philosophy underscored the Hood by Air show, a bawdy display of ideas, attitude and subversive theatrics all daring observers not to judge, simply accept. The collection was filled with oversize trousers and jackets, with shirts  â€”   folded neatly and still in their   sterility  â€”   displayed, rather than worn. The models wore   cowboy boots  â€”   the toes pointed in both directions so that the wearer looked like he was walking, or in many cases, skidding, in two directions at once. [These Hood by Air shoes are a metaphor for something, right?] Those shoes were a metaphor, of sorts, for fashion  â€”   for a lot of things. Which way are we going? Backwards or forwards? Or are we simply paralyzed by indecision  â€”   tripping over our own feet? Fashion is trying to have a conversation. And now, more than ever, it seems ready to talk to anyone willing to listen.

210451,770,primary,358," The Republican presidential campaign has entered what could be the most critical week of the primary season, with the party elites almost out of time to deny the GOP nomination to New York billionaire Donald Trump short of a potentially bloody fight at the national convention in July. Trumpâ€™s easy victories in Michigan and Mississippi demonstrated appeal from the Deep South to the industrial Midwest that continued his impressive winning string and added to his lead in delegates. While not unexpected, his margins  â€”   especially in Michigan  â€”   were bigger than his rivals had hoped they would be. So far his opponents have won only scattered victories by comparison but nothing that amounts to critical mass in the   movement. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has done better than Ohio Gov. John Kasich or Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, but none has yet emerged as strong enough alone to stop him, though Cruz may be best positioned to fill that role. After Tuesday, the   movementâ€™s   strategy rests on two candidates and two states: Kasich in Ohio and Rubio in Florida. But Tuesday showed there are no sure things ahead. Kasich has yet to win a contest and was looking for a clear and strong finish in Michigan to give him a boost. Instead he finished well behind Trump in Michigan and was in a fight with Cruz for second"
210451,771,tertiary,403,"   Tracking the race to the Republican nomination View Graphic     Tracking the race to the Republican nomination  Meanwhile, Tuesday continued Rubioâ€™s sudden and rapid descent. A few weeks ago, he was the establishment favorite, the man seen as best positioned to challenge Trump through the spring. Today he is a battered candidate. In Michigan, Rubio was scratching to reach double digits in the popular vote. That was impressive, compared with his showing in Mississippi, where he was mired in single digits, along with Kasich. In that state, as Trump romped, Cruz lapped the other two and finished second. Itâ€™s not out of the question that Kasich and Rubio could win their home states next week, but after what happened Tuesday, they will face heavy competition, and not just from Trump. Cruz also sees vulnerabilities in his rivals and will seek to exploit them. All of this comes despite signs that Trump, who has dominated the Republican race and defined the 2016 cycle for months with his bombastic rhetoric and unorthodox campaign style, has begun to show weakness and limits. As opposition to his candidacy has mounted inside the Republican Party, the lines have hardened around his candidacy, pro and con. In national polls, his margin is narrower than it once was. Nearly half of all Republicans say they would not be satisfied if he becomes the nominee, according to the latest Washington   News poll. His favorability rating among Republicans, while still net positive, has declined over the past few months. And in    tests against Cruz and Rubio, he loses, according to the same poll. Had this begun to happen two months ago, Trump might be far more vulnerable than he looks today  â€”   or so some Republicans would like to think. But even that is open to question. The party elites unloaded on Trump over the past week, led by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who portrayed Trump as unfit to be president and a lousy businessman. Wealthy donors offered up millions of dollars to   super PACs for attack ads"
210451,772,secondary,440,"   View Graphic      None of it seemed to have much effect Tuesday, although the focus of these efforts is targeted more on next weekâ€™s results. Up to now, according to the Republican rules, almost all states so far have awarded delegates on a proportional basis. But that begins to change next week in a way designed to help a   and hinder those behind. Starting next week, many states will award delegates on a    basis. Trump doesnâ€™t have to win half the vote to get all the delegates in upcoming states; he can do so with the kind of percentages he has rolled up so far. Trump still remains far short of the 1, 237 delegates needed to win the nomination. Losses in Ohio and Florida would block him from 165 delegates. But winning either or both would cripple efforts to prevent him from becoming the nominee. The possibility of a convention fight still looms. As of Tuesday night, more than 1, 000 delegates have been awarded. After next Tuesday, that jumps to almost 1, 500  â€”   of 2, 472 total. Trump still could be denied a   victory, but which among his rivals would be close enough to claim the right to be the alternative? Rubioâ€™s prospects have faded dramatically. He needs a stunning turnaround, beginning in Florida and then elsewhere. Kasich could win Ohio. If he were to do that, other Midwestern states could be fertile territory, but after what happened Tuesday in Michigan, he could not count on them. Cruz and his advisers long have believed that a    race would favor him over Trump. But a look at the calendar after next week raises questions about his path. So far, other than his victory in Texas, he has had trouble demonstrating that he has support that is significantly broader than his evangelical base. Right now, Cruz has done less well overall than former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who had a similar base of support, did in 2012. Both won the Iowa caucuses. Santorum went on to win 10 more states. Of the seven that have voted already this year, Cruz has won two, Rubio one and Trump four. Cruz can win caucus states and some smaller contests. His real test will come in states such as Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and California. Trump is still an unusual    â€”   polarizing in his own party and with vulnerabilities that become more apparent week by week. Were he to falter next week or after that, the   forces will be emboldened to continue their attacks. Their hope remains to keep him short of a majority and then upend him in Cleveland in July. But they needed a better result on Tuesday than they got. Trump remains in control of the race"
210451,773,tertiary,614,
198971,774,secondary,483, Primary voters going to the polls starting next week face the prospect of voting for candidates who have been unseen in the past 35 years of presidential politics: Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders
198971,775,secondary,423,"  But even if Trump and Sanders are denied the White House, their campaigns will have been extremely significant, perhaps even changing presidential politics forever. Their success in building a following in their parties is an early warning sign of discontent with the outlook that has dominated American politics for decades. Sanders and Trump differ dramatically on many issues  â€”   from immigration to climate change â€”   but both are critical of how wealthy donors and lobbyists dominate the political process, and both favor some form of campaign finance reform. Both decry corporations moving overseas for cheap wages and to avoid American taxes. Both reject trade treaties that favor multinational corporations over workers. And both want government more, rather than less, involved in the economy. Sanders is a   populist. He wants to defend the â€collapsing middle classâ€ against the â€billionaire classâ€ that controls the economy and politics. He is not a liberal who wants to reconcile Wall Street and Main Street, or a socialist who wants the working class to abolish capitalism"
198971,776,primary,568,  Trump is a   populist who wants to defend the American people from rapacious CEOs and from Hispanic illegal immigrants. He is not a conventional business conservative who thinks government is the problem and who blames Americaâ€™s ills on unions and Social Security
198971,777,primary,244,"  Both men are foes of what they describe as their partyâ€™s establishment. And both campaigns are also fundamentally about rejecting the way economic policy has been talked about in American presidential politics for decades. Sanders and Trump both reject widely accepted economic policies that favor business interests Both Sanders and Trump have challenged the main assumptions that have knit together American politics over the past 35 years. Some European political scientists describe these as a â€neoliberal consensus,â€ but there has not really been consensus  â€”   itâ€™s more a case of a dominant or hegemonic view  â€”   and the term â€neoliberalâ€ has sometimes been applied indiscriminately. So let me use the term â€market liberalismâ€  â€”   a cross between â€third wayâ€ liberalism among Democrats and Cato Institute libertarianism among Republicans  â€”   to describe this point of view"
198971,778,tertiary,357,"  From the 1930s through the â€™60s, American politics revolved around a New Deal liberal view that stressed managed capitalism,   cooperation, and political pluralism. During the late 1970s, however, that view began to be displaced by one that stressed the superiority of market   and the extension of market relations to global capitalism, particularly with respect to trade, immigration, and foreign investment. Government regulation and taxes were increasingly seen as hampering growth. Governmentâ€™s role was to remove regulations on business and get rid of barriers that prevented immigration, tariffs, and foreign investment. Economic policy over the past 35 years has largely embraced these objectives"
198971,779,tertiary,302,"   In 1977 the Occupational Safety and Health Agency had 37 inspectors for every million workers; now it has only 22. OSHAâ€™s effectiveness depends entirely on its inspectors. Marginal rates on the largest incomes have fallen from 70 percent during the 1970s to 39 percent today. Taxes on capital gains, which primarily affect the wealthy, have dropped from 40 percent in 1977 to 20 percent today. Trade agreements have eased the way for companies to move their businesses overseas. From 1990 to 1995, spanning the Republican George H. W. Bush and Democratic Bill Clinton administrations, 27 bilateral investment treaties were signed removing obstacles to American companies relocating overseas. Attempts to tax American corporationsâ€™ overseas earnings have been consistently beaten back during Democratic and Republican administrations. Major industries, including airlines and telecommunications, have been freed from price regulation"
198971,780,primary,664,"There have been short interruptions in this neoliberal trend  â€”   for instance, during the first two years of the Carter and Obama administrations  â€”   but these brief exceptions have, if anything, proven the rule. How this orthodoxy came to be so dominant in both parties What allowed these market liberal views to gain hegemony was, above all, the offensive that business undertook against labor unions and public interest groups. As I have recounted in The Paradox of American Democracy, it began in the early 1970s. Business used hardball tactics, including moving factories out of the unionized Midwest, hiring replacement workers, and firing labor organizers to block union drives and to decertify existing unions. In 1955, about a third of   workers belonged to unions; by 1989, it was down to 16. 4 percent. Business also dramatically increased its lobbying presence on Washingtonâ€™s K Street. In 1971, only 175 businesses had lobbies in Washington. By 1982, 2, 445 did. Businesses initially found useful allies in a Republican party that was bringing together local business, rural voters, and white   voters disillusioned with the Democrats. But as labor lost members and money, businesses also assumed a larger role in funding Democratic candidates. In 1992, Bill Clintonâ€™s single biggest bloc of contributions came from the employees of Goldman Sachs. And Clinton didnâ€™t disappoint his funders when he named Goldman Sachs president Robert Rubin as the head of his new National Economic Council and later as Treasury secretary, where he championed bringing China into the World Trade Organization (even as it continued to manipulate its currency and saving rates to achieve trade surpluses) and the deregulation of the financial industry. Businessâ€™s influence was magnified by a series of Supreme Court rulings  â€”   handed down by a court whose members had been nominated by Republican presidents. It began in 1976, when the courtâ€™s decision in Buckley v. Valeo threw out the campaign finance reforms of 1971 and 1974, which had established limits on both total contributions and total spending, and has continued through Citizens United and McCutcheon, which repealed, in effect, a   restriction on corporate contributions. As a result, businesses and the very wealthy are able to use their financial advantage to sway both Republicans and Democrats on economic legislation that is important to them"
198971,781,secondary,633,"  The changes wrought in Americaâ€™s international position after 1971 also reinforced businessâ€™s political dominance. As capital became mobile, companies could move overseas or south of the border to cut costs; they could also use the threat of moving overseas, or of competition from   production overseas, to force wage concessions in the United States. Businesses also took advantage of the influx of legal and illegal immigrants that poured into the country after the new immigration laws of 1965 to drive down the wages of production and service workers in industries like construction, hotels and restaurants, and meatpacking. These measures contributed to overall inequality, and they struck at industries like auto, textiles, and meatpacking that had been heavily unionized. The New Deal liberal order had depended upon labor functioning as a countervailing force to business. Business had still reigned supreme  â€”   as E. E. Schattschneider wrote in 1960, â€The flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong   accentâ€  â€”   but the balance between them still undergirded Americaâ€™s pluralist democracy and made possible a spate of popular reforms. These reforms ranged from Medicare during Lyndon Johnsonâ€™s administration to the 12 new regulatory agencies, including OSHA and the Environmental Protection Agency, that originated during the Nixon and Ford administrations. With the transition to a market liberal order, the prospect for these kind of reforms has dramatically diminished, and Americaâ€™s pluralism has increasingly lost its mooring. How Trump fights against the free market policies Republicans embraced Billionaire Donald Trump would seem an unlikely candidate to challenge this market liberal framework, but he is an outlier in a Republican Party that had become a bastion of free market economics. He is a former Democrat and political independent who seems to have gravitated to the Republican Party because it afforded him a better opportunity for political advancement. He has had little contact with, and shown little interest in, conservative ideology. He also comes from industries  â€”   real estate and construction  â€”   that depend on government largesse. During his presidential campaign, much attention has been focused on Trump calling Mexican immigrants rapists and on his proposing to bar Muslims temporarily from immigrating to the United States, but in his speeches and his campaign books, he has taken positions that run directly counter to neoliberalism and Republican libertarianism"
198971,782,secondary,682,"  Trump attacked corporate â€inversions,â€ when a company relocates its headquarters overseas in order to avoid taxes in the US. And he declared that Wall Street â€has caused tremendous problems for us. Weâ€™re going to tax Wall Street.â€ He criticized Ford and Nabisco for moving jobs out of the United States in search of lower wages. Some of Trumpâ€™s appeal, like that earlier of independent candidate Ross Perot, rests on his being able to finance his own campaign so he is not dependent on campaign contributions from the wealthy and from business lobbyists. â€I donâ€™t want lobbyists. I donâ€™t want any special interests. I donâ€™t want any strings attached,â€ Trump told Face the Nation last August. And he wants to curb the power of PACs and Super PACs. As a billionaire, he is making the case against the   and   political system. Trumpâ€™s attacks on illegal immigrants have a hard edge of xenophobia, but he is addressing an issue that is integral to the neoliberal framework. Trump has not only targeted undocumented immigrants for driving down services workersâ€™ wages and burdening social services; he has also criticized   visas for taking jobs away from American   workers. When Trump rounds on China, he sometimes seems to be encouraging a new â€yellow peril,â€ but his criticisms of Chinaâ€™s trade practices challenge the market liberal framework that has turned a blind eye to Chinese mercantilism and to American firms that take advantage of Chinaâ€™s cheap labor to export goods back to the United States that used to be produced in the US. Trumpâ€™s remedies may not work, but his Republican rivals refused to recognize the problem he is addressing. In the January 14 Republican debate, sponsored by Fox Business News, Trump charged that â€China is ripping us on trade.â€ Noting that the United States had lost â€thousands and thousandsâ€ of companies, he said he would consider imposing a tariff to bring down the $505 billion trade deficit with China"
198971,783,primary,657,"  Foxâ€™s moderator brought up the usual business response  â€”   that imposing a tariff would penalize the consumer. Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz agreed. Rubio said, â€The best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.â€ Trump has also rejected the typical   view of government. He has opposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare, and he has not fretted about debt and deficits. Instead, he has advocated massive government spending on infrastructure. He attacked Obamaâ€™s health care plan for subsidizing insurance companies and drug companies, and has joined Sanders and Clinton in calling for curbing drug prices. Some of the Republican opposition to Trump stems from a fear that his harsh rhetoric about Hispanics and women would condemn the party to defeat in November. But much of it also comes from opposition to his positions on government, trade, and foreign investment. The Club for Growth, which backs free market candidates, explained its opposition to Trump by citing his support for â€universal health care,â€ the idea that â€government can take over companies,â€ his proposal to raise taxes on individuals with a worth greater than $10 million, and his proposal to impose a tariff on goods from China. In National Reviewâ€™s brief against Trump, conservatives cited his support for â€universal health care,â€ â€his   protectionismâ€ and â€his plans for spending but no serious proposals for spending cuts or entitlement reforms.â€ How Sanders tugs Democrats back to their economic roots Sanders, with his New Left pedigree, is a much more predictable foe of market liberalism among Democrats as well as Republicans. Until he ran for president, Sanders was an independent, not a Democrat. He has no endorsements from current senators or governors (even in his home state) and only two endorsements from House members. Some Democrats share some of his political ideas, but as a whole, what Sanders thinks runs counter to the prevailing ideology of the past three Democratic administrations. Sanders still calls himself a socialist, although he has abandoned the Marxist conception of socialism as public ownership and control of the means of production. He also calls himself a progressive and was a founder of the House Progressive Caucus, but he is not exactly in the tradition of progressives or liberals. Progressives and liberals want to reconcile the competing demands of capital and labor"
198971,784,tertiary,657,"  Sanders is much more of a   populist who sees a virtuous people arrayed against an establishment. Asked by NBCâ€™s Chuck Todd why he thought he had no Senate endorsements, Sanders replied: â€It tells me that we are taking on the political establishment, weâ€™re taking on the economic establishment, the financial interest in this country, and weâ€™re taking on the corporate establishment.â€ In an exchange with Martin Oâ€™Malley in one of the January debates, Sanders drew a clear distinction between his outlook and that of a conventional liberal or a neoliberal. When Oâ€™Malley declared that the â€biggest challenge we face as a people   â€¦     is to heal the divisions and wounds in our country,â€ Sanders said he disagreed. â€Where I disagree with you, Governor Oâ€™Malley, is we do have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires who control the economic and political life of this country.â€ Sanders, like Trump, takes positions on specific issues that put him at odds with market liberalism. His proposals, whether or not they are immediately feasible, challenge an approach that prioritizes the private market. He unblushingly favors huge government spending  â€”   $1 trillion worth  â€”   on infrastructure and would pay for that and for free public college tuition by tax hikes on speculation and the wealthy that Clinton, for one, opposes. He wants Medicare for all, which would mean eliminating private health insurers except as they might supplement government programs. Sanders opposes trade agreements that he believes encourage American companies to invest overseas rather than at home, and wants to close tax loopholes that would allow â€corporate desertersâ€ to avoid American taxes. Like Trump, he promises to be tough on China. He wants to break up the biggest banks by reinstating the   Act that the Clinton administration and Congress repealed. And while he favors comprehensive immigration reform, he joins Trump in charging that the   program, cherished by Silicon Valley Democrats, deprives Americans of jobs. While Trump has financed his own campaign, Sanders, unlike Clinton, has relied on small donors and avoided PACs or Super PACs. He wants public funding of campaigns and promises to make overturning Citizens United a litmus test in a Supreme Court nomination. But the heart of his case against the current political arrangement comes in his call for â€political revolution,â€ which he regularly defines as â€involving millions and millions of people in the political process today in a way that has never been the case before.â€ Sanders is referring not simply to election turnout, but to the kind of popular presence between elections that could counter the power of the â€billionaire class.â€ Sandersâ€™s view, however vague, is a call to reverse the oligarchic tendencies of the past decades. Only an organized movement from below could conceivably do that"
198971,785,tertiary,439,"  The two messages draw in different kinds of voters Sanders and Trump appeal to very different constituencies. According to a January Pew poll, Trumpâ€™s voters tend on average (but not exclusively) to be white, male, older, without a college degree, and in the middle or   income quintile. They are the descendants of the white   Reagan Democrats who made possible  â€”   but didnâ€™t constitute the bulk of  â€”   the Republican majorities of the past 35 years. As a new RAND survey has shown, Trumpâ€™s supporters are more likely to express resentments toward racial minorities and undocumented immigrants and to favor â€progressive economic policies.â€ Sandersâ€™s voters, on the other hand, tend to be younger, are attending or have graduated from college, and are in the   income quintile. There are signs of some   support, but for the most part Sandersâ€™s supporters are more likely to be potential or existing professionals that as a group have played a similar role in Democratic majorities as the white working class in Republican majorities. In surveys, they currently tend to be white and male, but that is largely out of comparison with Hillary Clinton, who enjoys widespread support among women and minorities. In New Hampshire, I found some voters who said they would support either Trump or Sanders, and some other reporters have come up with additional examples of potential crossover voters, but I donâ€™t think at present the bulk of either candidateâ€™s voters would favor the other. The gulf on minorities, immigrants, climate change, and the general attitude toward women is too great. The Sanders and Trump constituencies are parts of a whole that doesnâ€™t yet exist, but if it were to come into being it could potentially shake the foundations of present market liberal politics. A fear of a similar coalition  â€”   in this case between New Left student activists and striking   workers  â€”   motivated the business offensive of the â€™70s. In December 1969 in a special issue on â€The Seventies,â€ Businessweek speculated that â€the blacks, the labor unions and the youngâ€ could â€make the Seventies one of the tumultuous decades in American history.â€ Of course, businessâ€™s quick and determined response prevented that from happening, but over the next decades, if market liberal policies lead to further downturns like the Great Recession, as some economists predict, the Trump and Sanders voters could come together. The question is, however, what form the new politics would take"
198971,786,primary,605,"  What might a   constituency look like? What is happening in the United States is very similar to what is happening in Europe. In Europe,   populist parties are on the march in much of the northern tier, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and even Sweden, as well as in Austria and Eastern Europe. In the southern tier of Spain, Italy, and Greece,   and centrist populism predominates. If anything, the issues in Europe are more complicated because of the euro and the European Union and the predominance of Germany, but basically what these different populist movements are advocating is an economic nationalism very similar to that which Trump and Sanders are calling for. What is happening to the United States and Western Europe now can be compared to what happened from the 1870s to the beginning of World War II. During this earlier period, capital and a laissez faire view of the economy initially reigned supreme, and, as Thomas Piketty has demonstrated, economic inequality grew apace, as it has over the past 40 years. There were initial outbursts similar to those that the United States and Western Europe are experiencing now  â€”   the populists and socialists in the United States, the socialist and Labour parties in Europe  â€”   but they didnâ€™t cohere into a powerful challenge until the decades after World War I and the onset of the Great Depression. When they did come together, however, the challenge took two very different forms. In the United States, the breakdown of the old order led to the triumph of the New Deal on the left. In Europe, it resulted in the rise of fascism. So the breakup of a   order can turn left or right, and which direction the revolt will take in the United States remains to be seen. What can be said is that the Trump and Sanders campaigns, taken together, could be harbingers of that revolt. "

178666,794,primary,108," U. S. President Donald Trump accused predecessor Barack Obama on Saturday of wiretapping him during the late stages of the 2016 election campaign, but offered no evidence for an allegation which an Obama spokesman said was â€simply falseâ€. Trump made the accusation in a series of early morning tweets just weeks into his administration and amid rising scrutiny of his campaignâ€™s ties to Russia. â€How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is  . Bad (or sick) guy! ,â€ Trump wrote in one tweet. â€Iâ€™d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!â€ The remarkable tussle between the current and former presidents just 45 days since the handover of power is the latest twist in a controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency. U. S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Trump has accused officials in Obamaâ€™s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said it had been a â€cardinal ruleâ€ of the Obama administration that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. â€Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false,â€ Lewis said in a statement. The statement did not address the possibility that a wiretap of the Trump campaign could have been ordered by Justice Department officials. Trump said the alleged wiretapping took place in his Trump Tower office and apartment building in New York, but there was â€nothing found.â€ The White House did not respond to a request to elaborate on Trumpâ€™s accusations. AIDES CAUGHT BY SURPRISE Trump was spending the weekend at his Florida seaside resort,   . He was scheduled to meet with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly before a dinner with officials also including adviser Steve Bannon and White House Counsel Don McGahn, the White House said. Amid a political storm, Sessions on Thursday announced he would stay out of any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election after it emerged he met last year with Russiaâ€™s ambassador, although he maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meeting. A Trump spokeswoman said the president spent part of Saturday â€having meetings, making phone calls and hitting ballsâ€ at his golf course in West Palm Beach. His supporters, meanwhile, staged small rallies in at least 28 of the countryâ€™s 50 states, most of which passed off peacefully. But there were clashes in the famously   city of Berkeley, California, where protesters from both sides hit each other over the head with wooden sticks. Trumpâ€™s tweets caught his aides by surprise, with one saying it was unclear what the president was referring to. Members of Congress said Trumpâ€™s accusations require investigation or explanation. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, described the allegations as serious and said the public deserved more information. He said in a statement it was possible that Trump had been illegally tapped, but, if so, the president should explain what sort of tap it was and how he knew about it. U. S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called Trumpâ€™s assertion a â€spectacularly reckless allegationâ€. â€If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nationâ€™s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them,â€ Schiff said in a statement. Former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes strongly denied Trumpâ€™s allegations: â€No president can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,â€ Rhodes wrote on Twitter.

Obama imposed sanctions on Russia and ordered Russian diplomats to leave the United States in December over the countryâ€™s involvement in hacking political parties in the Nov. 8 U. S. presidential election. Under U. S. law, a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an â€agent of a foreign powerâ€ in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of Trump Tower. Several conservative news outlets and commentators have made allegations in recent days about Trump being wiretapped during the campaign, without offering any evidence.

214566,805,primary,859,"     SAN DIEGO  â€”   In a famous xkcd cartoon, â€œDuty Calls,â€ a manâ€™s partner beckons him to bed as he sits alone at his computer. â€œI canâ€™t. This is important,â€ he demurs, pecking furiously at the keyboard. â€œWhat?â€ comes the reply. His answer: â€œSomeone is wrong on the Internet. â€ His nighttime frustration is my day job. I work at Snopes. com, the   site pledged to running down rumors, debunking cant and calling out liars. Just this past week, for instance, we wrestled with a mysterious lump on Hillary Clintonâ€™s back that turned out to be a mic pack (not the defibrillator some had alleged). Itâ€™s a noble and worthwhile calling, but itâ€™s also a Sisyphean one. On the Internet, no matter how many facts you marshal, someone is always wrong. Every day, the battle against error begins with email. At Snopes, which is supported entirely by advertising, our staff of about a dozen writers and editors plows through some 1, 000 messages that have accumulated overnight, which helps us get a feel for what our readers want to know about this morning. Unfortunately, it also means a healthy helping of venom, racism and fury. A   email specialist on staff helps sort the wheat (real questions we could answer) from the vituperative chaff. Out in the physical world (where we rarely get to venture during the election season, unless itâ€™s to investigate yet another rumor about PokÃ©mon Go) our interactions with the siteâ€™s readers are always positive. But in the virtual world, anonymous communication emboldens the disaffected to treat us as if we were agents of whatever theyâ€™re perturbed by today. The writers of these missives, who often send the same message over and over, think theyâ€™re on to us: Weâ€™re shills for big government, big pharma, the Department of Defense or any number of other prominent, arguably shadowy organizations. You have lost all credibility! they tell us. They never consider that the actual truth is whatâ€™s on our website  â€”   that weâ€™re completely independent. Many of these emails share a common theme that I find puzzling. They assume we are personal friends with the Clintons or the Trumps, or else weâ€™re funded  â€”   and thus controlled  â€”   by billionaire George Soros. Iâ€™ve known a few people from Little Rock, but thatâ€™s about as close as Iâ€™ve ever come to the Clintons personally. Iâ€™ve never met Trump. And my knowledge of Soros begins and ends with this: Heâ€™s really rich, and he (like many other extraordinarily rich people with philanthropic leanings) funds some journalistic endeavors. But he doesnâ€™t fund us, and neither do any of the others. Buried amid the dung heaps of email are some actual gems of information or leads on stories that we should write. Many of our pages are up because people have asked us to investigate specific stories or claims. So we sift through all the conspiracy theories to find what people need us to demystify or research. For instance, we received many questions about whether flossing is still medically necessary. (Answer: Even if the science is unclear, do it for everyone around you.) After picking through the mail, we move on to discussing what weâ€™re all going to write. What have we heard about the most? Whatâ€™s in the headlines? Whatâ€™s in the campaign? Because of my background and interests, I like to write about immigration, geopolitics, international relations, space and science, although Iâ€™m not the only person who writes about such things; other staffers have expertise in different and wildly varied subjects. Then, we read the 300 or so messages that have accumulated in the past hour. I spot a question that Iâ€™d like to answer: Can you get sexually transmitted diseases from a tanning bed? The query seems straightforward enough, although some of the most   questions can unearth a treasure trove of things to research. Strange medical stories are a lot of fun to write, especially as a change of pace during an election cycle; Iâ€™ve also looked into whether thereâ€™s a correlation between hand size and penis size (there isnâ€™t, but there is a correlation between the relative lengths of fingers and penis size) and whether you can get tattoos on your eyeballs (you can). In the   case, I donâ€™t know. It seems possible, doesnâ€™t it? I start sifting through medical studies about the ability of viruses to survive on glass, get stuck on one particularly dry paper and call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to see whether I can get any leads. Someone there, acting as if they get calls like this all the time, refers me to another person. I leave a message and return to my studies. Success! Iâ€™ve found proof that catching any kind of sexually transmitted disease from a tanning bed, even a dirty one, is extremely unlikely. I start writing up the data I have pulled together as I keep one eye on social media, one ear on the headlines and another ear on my phoneâ€™s scanner app  â€”   which alerts me to    activity on police scanners throughout the United States  â€”   while I edit articles as our writers submit them. The CDC gets back to me with a quote further confirming what Iâ€™ve found, so I work that into my story as well. Sometimes, breaking down stories to their bare facts is satisfying in its own right; itâ€™s the thrill of the hunt. We all love to do research and find the nugget of truth beneath the veneers of shock, delight, outrage  â€”   whatever makes a story worth passing around. But even when itâ€™s too obvious to be thrilling (it doesnâ€™t take any digging to determine that Queen Elizabeth is not a â€œlizard personâ€) this work is a social good. In addition to the hate mail, we receive a lot of frightened mail, from people who arenâ€™t certain about their place in an increasingly scary world, where danger seemingly lurks around every corner. Times are changing, yes, but some websites take advantage of that uncertainty by plucking stories from the news and fluffing them up to make it appear as though thereâ€™s going to be a major disaster any minute now. (Recent examples included activity on a major fault line that supposedly signified an imminent massive earthquake on the West Coast, and the closure of cargo routes in the North Atlantic. Neither of these stories were true.) Concerned people pass along the stories, â€œjust in case,â€ and spread the anxiety further. The people who own clickbait sites are never held accountable for dealing in fear. They do, however, make quite a lot of money from advertising. We donâ€™t think that our work will affect people committed to their belief systems to the exclusion of all facts. But Snopes can be a place where people begin their own research; we can be a reference for people who care to excavate the facts behind the   headlines. We donâ€™t pretend to be, nor do we want to be, the final word on any subject. We would like to be a starting point, though. In cases where clickability and virality trump fact, we feel that knowledge is the best antidote to fear."

If Willie Nelson hadnâ€™t fashioned himself into the artist he is over the course of thousands of performances and some   albums, who couldâ€™ve dreamed him up? Heâ€™s been the epitome of consistency, each of his shows an easygoing epic, each album loosely held together by a narrative or stylistic thread, each project expanding on countryâ€™s troubadour tradition. And yet, heâ€™s also the most capricious of musicians, willing to let himself be guided by his whims, so wily and   in the phrasing of his vocals and guitar figures that trying to match his wavering rhythms is a foolâ€™s errand. On his rich, new album, Godâ€™s Problem Child, Nelson likewise attributes an incongruous range of qualities to the passage of time itself. Where some artists embrace somber,   meditations on mortality as a way to make a final case for their depth and burnish their legacies, at age 84, Nelson reflects on this season of his life with a mischievousness and equanimity that already feels familiar coming from him. Bookending the album are songs that convey nostalgia for places and people: the gospelly   romp â€Little House on the Hillâ€  â€”   a   cut for songwriter Lyndel Rhodes, the nonagenarian mother of Nelsonâ€™s seasoned producer, Buddy Cannon, whoâ€™s been on quite the roll this year  â€”   and â€He Wonâ€™t Ever Be Gone,â€ a twangy, Gary   tribute to Nelsonâ€™s late peer and comrade, Merle Haggard. Between those two numbers, Nelson unfurls gentle, but unsparing insights. â€It Gets Easierâ€ might bring to mind the similarly titled string of confessional videos aimed at reassuring troubled LGBTQ tweens and teens that they have plenty to look forward to, but Nelsonâ€™s tone is hardly optimistic heâ€™s singing, with elegant empathy, about how easy it is to withdraw from living a fully engaged life as you get older. The classic country waltz â€Your Memory Has a Mind of Its Ownâ€  â€”   one of seven songs on here that he   with Cannon via text message  â€”   is haunted by a loved oneâ€™s inescapable absence, while the ruminative ballad â€True Loveâ€ lifts up a romanticism that endures despite the bruises of experience. â€Iâ€™ll leave this world believing, true love, youâ€™re still my friend,â€ Nelson murmurs. Since there have been so many internet rumors of his impending death over the years, he makes a wry joke of his mortality in â€Still Not Dead,â€ the albumâ€™s most energetic number. He also channels the soulful scoundrel side of his persona into â€Godâ€™s Problem Child,â€ which features the late Leon Russell and whose authors, Jamey Johnson and Tony Joe White, take turns singing lead. A ruminative blues number, itâ€™s a chance for Nelson to play guitar solos in impish spurts. But heâ€™s not interested in maintaining an illusion of invulnerability. During â€Old Timer,â€ a stately piano ballad laced with his longtime harmonica player Mickey Raphaelâ€™s reedy, disconsolate notes, Nelson conveys melancholy awareness of the contradiction between a lively mind and deteriorating body. He still sings with grace, and itâ€™s moving to hear his vocal instrument finally beginning to betray a bit of frailty in his ninth decade. Temperate, fickle and revelatory in turns, his is truly a voice to trust."

With much of the world still reeling from the digital breach that prevented people from receiving hospital care, a second wave of what European officials have called â€œthe biggest ransomware attack everâ€ could be devastating. â€œTheyâ€™re going to turn on their computers in the morning and find out if they were protected or not,â€ said James Barnett, a security expert at Venable and retired Navy rear admiral. The software, which first affected Britainâ€™s National Health Service before spreading to as many as 150 countries, locked down victimsâ€™ computers and threatened to delete their files unless they paid $300 in bitcoins. It primarily targeted users of Windows XP, an aging operating system for which Microsoft largely ended support in 2014"
207526,818,primary,178,"Much of the potential damage from Fridayâ€™s attack was quickly contained by the efforts of a     security researcher, who goes by @MalwareTechBlog on Twitter. The researcher discovered that the unnamed attackers had accidentally included a â€œkill switchâ€ in their software that would allow the owner of a particular website to stop the attack. By paying about $10 to acquire the domain name, the researcher was able to thwart the malware. But that victory could be   experts said, because the software, known as WannaCry or Wanna Decryptor, is likely to be modified soon and continue its spread in a slightly different form. For IT workers and security researchers, the episode highlights the challenge of fighting an   foe whose motives are rarely clear. WannaCry is the most   example of a type of attack that analysts have been predicting would surge in 2017 after a substantial uptick in such attacks last year. â€œIf you looked at what the biggest trends all the security companies were highlighting at the beginning of the year, ransomware was in all of their lists,â€ said Peter Warren Singer, a technologist and senior fellow at the New America Foundation. He added that interventions by independent researchers such as @MalwareTechBlog highlight the benefits of supporting private hacking. â€œIf there is a lesson from that,â€ Singer said, itâ€™s that â€œyou want to enable security research and information exchange. You want the curiosity of the good guys to be unleashed as much as possible. â€ Among those waking up Monday to a nasty surprise could be government officials, some analysts said. Many public computers still have Windows XP installed, and they could be susceptible to the malware if IT administrators have not downloaded the appropriate security patches. Some federal agencies have moved more quickly than others to stamp out Windows XP, said R. David Edelman, an Obama administration official who advised the White House on technology matters. How adept each agency has been at upgrading its systems has largely to do with available resources. â€œThere are certainly still systems in the government that are running XP,â€ Edelman said. â€œSome of them are almost certainly  ; some of them might be further   or otherwise not as vulnerable. â€ In 2015, the Navy agreed to pay Microsoft $9 million a year for continued Windows XP support.

167708,822,tertiary,121,"Miss Manners and skilled prep cooks should be pleased: Our early human ancestors likely mastered the art of chopping and slicing more than 2 million years ago. Not only did this yield daintier pieces of meat and vegetables that were much easier to digest raw, with less chewing  â€”   it also helped us along the road to becoming modern humans, researchers reported Wednesday. And our ancestors picked up these skills at least 1. 5 million years before cooking took off as a common way to prepare food, the researchers say. Chewing, it turns out, takes a lot of time and energy, say Katherine Zink and Daniel Lieberman, evolutionary biologists at Harvard University. They recently set about measuring precisely how much effort is required to chew raw food, and to what degree simple stone tools might have eased the toil. â€Every time I go out to dinner, I watch people chew,â€ Lieberman tells us. â€And sometimes, I actually count how many times they chew.â€ Itâ€™s not just a hobby. Liebermanâ€™s interest gets to some basic questions of how humans evolved. Scientists have long known that Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans who lived about 2 million years ago, had already evolved to have a bigger body and brain than earlier hominins, and would have needed much more daily energy to survive. But the jaw and teeth of H. erectus were much like ours today  â€”   significantly smaller and less powerful than those of Australopithecus afarensis, or other hominins of earlier epochs. A diet that included cooked meat would have provided that ready energy without the need for sharp canines and big grinders. But the research evidence is pretty clear that cooking didnâ€™t become common until about 500, 000 years ago, Lieberman says. So, how did H. erectus get the needed calories? To test a   hypothesis that simple food processing might be the answer, Zink and Lieberman invited some Harvard colleagues to what Zink calls â€a lab cafÃ©,â€ and served them small portions of carrots, beets, jewel yams and goat meat. The food was served variously as roasted or raw sliced, pounded or left in hunks. â€If I were to give you raw goat,â€ Lieberman says, â€youâ€™d chew, and nothing would happen.â€ Like a lot of wild game, goat meat tends to be stringy, he says. Chewing a big piece makes it more elastic, but it doesnâ€™t readily break into pieces. â€But if you cut goat into smaller pieces,â€ he says, â€your ability to chew it would improved dramatically.â€ All the volunteers (14 for the vegetables and just 10 for the goat meat) wore a number of small sensors pasted to their faces, to detect and count contractions of various muscle fibers as they chewed the bite of food to the point of swallowing. The scientists then translated those contractions into a measure of muscular effort, and also checked to see how well the food was broken up. Their results, published in the journal Nature, suggest that when eating a diet made up of   meat, if early humans pounded the vegetables before eating them, and sliced the meat, they would need to chew 17 percent less often and 26 percent less forcefully than if they started with larger slabs of the food. Every little flex of the jaw and grinding of the teeth adds up: Over the course of a year, Lieberman says, simply having a sharp stone to slice meat would reduce the number of â€chewsâ€ needed by 2. 5 million. â€I think itâ€™s amazing,â€ he says, â€to think that the simple stone tool could have a massive effect on how effectively we chew a piece of meat.â€ Itâ€™s possible, he and Zink think, that the benefits of   and food processing favored the transition to smaller teeth and jaws. But it seems more likely, they write in their study, that tool use and   simply reduced the evolutionary pressure to have big, powerful jaws and sharp teeth, â€thus permitting selection to decrease facial and dental size for other functions, such as speech production, locomotion, thermoregulation, or, perhaps even changes in the size and shape of the brain.â€ Several years ago, as part of our Meat Week coverage, we put together a    cookbook  â€”   based on archaeological digs and actual historical texts  â€”   tracing humanityâ€™s changing relationship with meat.

193746,823,secondary,805," Digital payment providers in India have mobilized hundreds of extra workers to enroll small merchants and offered their services for free, betting that severe cash shortages will prove to be the opportunity of a lifetime. Signing people up, however, may be the easy part. Getting shops and customers to change their reliance on cash permanently will involve convincing people like Mohammad Javed, a    meat shop owner in New Delhi. Working out of a bustling market in the capital, he is surrounded by banks and ATM machines, but says he does not know how to use a credit card machine, let alone a mobile wallet. He says business has dropped since Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s shock move on Nov. 8 to ditch higher value banknotes, but Javed does not believe mobile app providers offer a solution to his problem   or to his customers. â€We donâ€™t have knowledge or resources to open a mobile wallet or   machine, and our customers who pay   rupees ($1. $2. 92) are not interested either,â€ he said. Javedâ€™s reluctance is a reality check for the likes of Paytm and smaller rival MobiKwik, which have gone into promotional overdrive since Modiâ€™s announcement. The prime minister, whose government supports digital payments, brought in demonetization to crack down on the shadow economy and improve tax collection. â€Why should India not make a beginning in creating a â€™  society? â€™,â€ he said on Sunday, â€Once we embark on our journey to create a â€™  societyâ€™ the goal of â€™cashless societyâ€™ will not remain very far.â€ PROMISING SIGNS The companies say results have been promising so far. Paytm, backed by Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( ) has added 700 sales representatives since Nov. 8, taking its number of agents to 5, 000. The company, which has 4, 500   employees, plans to double the number of agents to more than 10, 000, as it aggressively expands its network. It says it has nearly doubled the number of small merchants signed up to its services to 1. 5 million in the last few weeks and added eight million clients to the 150 million it had before the banknote ban. MobiKwik, whose backers include U. S. venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and American Express ( ) said it had increased its agent base to more than 10, 000 from about 1, 000 before the Modi move. Merchants on its platform have risen to 250, 000 from 150, 000 previously, and chief executive Bipin Preet Singh said they were aiming for a million in up to two months. It has added 5 million accounts since Nov. 8, bringing the total to 40 million. But challenges loom. Credit Suisse estimates more than 90 percent of consumer purchases are made in cash, as millions still do not have bank accounts. Those who do have bank cards mainly use them to withdraw from cash machines. Sales of cheap smartphones have boomed in recent years, but internet networks remain patchy, especially in rural India. Financial literacy and technology usage also remain low. Dillip Kumar Agrahari, a vegetable seller in a Mumbai suburb, recently signed up to Paytm but does not know how to operate a smartphone. He hopes switching to digital payments will improve his business as the cash crunch drags on, but says he will have to depend on a cousin to help with accounts. Many businesses have traditionally opted for cash transactions because they are hard for the tax man to trace, given sales taxes are typically at least 10 percent. Mangal Singh, a furniture store owner, said nearly 80 percent of his business was transacted in cash, even though he accepts credit card payments. â€We are working on   margins,â€ he said. â€If we are asked to pay 12. 5 percent tax and other charges, we will have to close down our shops.â€ Concerns also remain about the infrastructure for mobile payments, as customers or merchants from one platform cannot transfer payments to another. MobiKwik said it had started offering    transfers, though not all rivals were on board. WHEN WILL PROFITS COME? The challenges raise questions about whether the business models of mobile payments providers are sustainable. Paytm recently slashed fees until Dec. 31, from a system of fees that ranged from 1 to 4 percent, with the most lucrative coming from telephone and utility bill payments. MobiKwik is not charging fees until March 2017. The   companies are  .

167375,838,secondary,417,"Author Isaac Asimov once wrote, â€The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not â€™Eureka!â€™ but, â€™Thatâ€™s funny . .. â€™ â€ Good scientists search for the significance of surprises, coincidences and mistakes. With a little curiosity and perseverance, they can turn unexpected incidents into new insights. The Golden Mole Award, from NPRâ€™s Skunk Bear, celebrates these moments of serendipity in science. We asked for examples of happy accidents in the lab and in the field from the past few years . .. and 300 submissions came pouring in. Here are a few of our favorite stories  â€”   a shortlist of Golden Mole Award nominees. 1. WHEN FROGS ATTACK, Carlos Jared was doing fieldwork in the jungles of southwest Brazil when he picked up a   frog. The frog twisted and thrashed, butting Jaredâ€™s hand with his head. Excruciating pain spread up Jaredâ€™s arm, and for the next five hours he was in agony. He had inadvertently discovered that frogs can be venomous. Many amphibians secrete toxins through their skin, but the frog Jared picked up  â€”   Greeningâ€™s frog  â€”   was the first discovered to actually force those toxins into a predatorâ€™s bloodstream. When attacked, it retracts the skin around its upper lip, revealing bony spines. Jared and collaborator Edmund Brodie discovered that a gland at the base of each spine produces a toxic mucus that is twice as potent as the venom of a Brazilian pit viper. 2. A LIGHT BULB MOMENT, Engineer David Awschalom had just moved from the University of California, Santa Barbara to the University of Chicago when his research hit a snag. His team was investigating a strange material that they hoped could someday be used in quantum computing  â€”   a thin sheet of atoms on a bed of strontium titanate. But their experimental results were full of incomprehensible noise. It took months for graduate students Andrew Yeats and Peter Mintun to isolate the problem: the labâ€™s new   light bulbs, installed per university policy. The bulbs happened to emit the exact wavelength of light that could polarize the strontium titanate and influence their new materialâ€™s electrical properties. With a little tweaking, they were able to use this wavelength to gently and rapidly â€paintâ€ electrical junctions on the fragile material. Shine light of a second specific wavelength, and the circuits were erased. What amounts to an optical Etch A Sketch could someday help scientists build quantum computers. 3. OUT OF THE BLUE, Blue is a notoriously tricky pigment. Itâ€™s rare in nature  â€”   the stone originally used to produce blue paint was once worth more than gold. So humans tried to manufacture the blues they needed . .. with mixed results. The dyes and paints they came up with often turned out to be poisonous, expensive, impermanent  â€”   or all three. Mas Subramanian wasnâ€™t at all interested in this problem. In the department of chemistry at Oregon State University, he was looking for materials with novel magnetic properties to use in advanced computer hard drives. He would mix up likely chemicals and bake them in a furnace at 2, 000 degrees Farenheit. But when he added manganese oxide to the recipe, he got a colorful surprise  â€”   a pile of bright blue powder. The new pigment is stable and nontoxic. It reflects infrared radiation, so it might help keep buildings and vehicles cool. Subramanian is working with paint manufacturers and energy conservation companies to develop the product. 4. BEATING THE HEAT, Climate change poses a major threat to pikas, adorable little mammals that live mostly in the mountains of the American West. They can overheat in temperatures as low as 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Most make their dens at higher elevations, in rock slides where they can stay cool. But one population in Oregonâ€™s Columbia Gorge thrives near sea level. Ecologist Johanna Varner wanted to find out why. She spent months watching pikas and deploying heat sensors at this   site. For reference, she did the same at a more typical site, along the slopes of nearby Mount Hood. Days after her first summer in the field ended, a fire consumed the Mount Hood site, burning trees to the ground and destroying all the food stores of the pikas. The experiment she had planned was ruined  â€”   her mountainside â€controlâ€ site was clearly no longer controlled. But after some tears and a couple of cold beers, Varner realized the disaster was an opportunity. First, there were the data collected by her heat sensors during the fire. The temperature in the pika dens, she discovered, never rose above 75 degrees F, even when   fires were raging just feet away. Secondly, her summer spent surveying the pika population formed a rare reference point for the study of a speciesâ€™ recovery after the fire. 5. THE DANCE OF THE DROPLETS, As an undergrad, Nate Cira was looking at food coloring under a microscope when he noticed something odd. Two drops of different colors seemed to dance around each other, almost as if they were alive. When Cira started graduate school at Stanford University, he showed the oddity to his adviser, Manu Prakash. Both men became obsessed with the phenomenon. They spent three years trying to figure out what was causing the strange motion. It turns out the dynamic dance was the result of two simple physical phenomena: surface tension and evaporation. The vapor given off by one droplet acted like a signal to the other  â€”   they were, in a sense, communicating. The principles Prakash, Cira and their collaborator Adrien Benusiglio uncovered could be used to create autonomic liquid machines, such as   solar panels. 6. A CASE OF MISTAKEN GENITALIA, Melissa Brown was at Northwestern University studying mice with multiple sclerosis. Like most MS researchers, Brown exclusively used female mice  â€”   the males just donâ€™t get sick. She was embarking on a set of experiments using mice with a genetic mutation that hobbles their immune system. Normal female mice get very sick. Female mice with the mutation seem to do better. Brown wanted to find out why. But when the results came in, some of them were the opposite of what was expected. Some of the normal mice were healthy. Some of the mice with the mutation were getting sick. A closer inspection of the test subjects revealed why. The mice with the surprising results were male! A graduate student on the project, Margaret Caulfield, was new to the lab and hadnâ€™t yet learned to identify the nearly imperceptible genitals of male mouse pups. The   turned out to be a lucky one. It helped Brown, Caulfield and graduate student Abby Russi pinpoint a special group of cells that protect male mice from MS  â€”   innate lymphoid cells. The discovery opens new doors for MS researchers. 7. THE SECRET IN THE SERUM, A disease called myelofibrosis causes scar tissue to grow inside bone marrow. It all starts when white blood cells called monocytes enter the marrow and turn into fibrocytes. For years, scientists have searched for a way to stop fibrocyte formation. The only problem? The process was impossible to study. Under normal lab conditions, when monocytes are grown in blood serum, the transformation just doesnâ€™t happen. No fibrocytes. Darrell Pilling and Richard Gomer, biologists at Texas AM, were recently investigating an entirely different kind of blood cell. They wanted to find out if T cells could survive in a   culture. Unbeknownst to the researchers, their   samples were contaminated with monocytes. And when they looked at their culture under a microscope, they saw . .. fibrocytes. Something in the serum had been keeping the monocytes from transforming. Pilling and Gomer rapidly changed gears, abandoning their work on T cells and focusing on the monocytes instead. They managed to isolate the serum protein that stopped fibrocyte formation. It is now being tested as a treatment for myelofibrosis. 8. WASPS, FACE TO FACE, As a young graduate student, Liz Tibbetts was studying social hierarchy in wasp colonies. She caught the wasps and painted dots on their backs, so she could tell them apart, and then videotaped their behavior. Tibbetts failed to mark a few of the wasps and didnâ€™t realize her mistake until she was reviewing the video. It was a problem. If she couldnâ€™t follow individuals, she couldnâ€™t get the data she needed. But, looking a bit closer, she realized she could tell the wasps apart without the paint. The face of each insect had distinct colors and shapes. Tibbetts wondered if the wasps could also recognize each other. To an experienced researcher this might have seemed outlandish  â€”   prevailing wisdom held that social insects couldnâ€™t distinguish between individuals. But Tibbetts was new to the field, and so she asked the question anyway. Her research showed that not only can wasps tell each other apart, but their tiny brains have evolved in a way that allows them to particularly recognize faces. This ability allows for complex social interactions within colonies. 9. A COLORFUL DEFENSE, Bacteria can be wildly colorful, blooming in bright red and yellow colonies. But researchers studying bacterial disease usually arenâ€™t focused on aesthetics. George Liu, working at the University of California, San Diego, was no exception. He was looking at two varieties of Streptococcus  â€”   a normal strain and a mutant strain that couldnâ€™t produce a nasty toxin. (The mutant also couldnâ€™t produce pigment, but that didnâ€™t seem important.) Liuâ€™s experiments were going terribly, full of inconsistent results. Sometimes the bacteria inexplicably died off. Then Liu caught a whiff of bleach in his glassware. An enthusiastic undergraduate had been using bleach to clean the labâ€™s beakers and flasks, and hadnâ€™t rinsed them properly. Reviewing his results, Liu noticed that the normal strain of bacteria survived the bleach more often than the mutant strain. But why? Was the toxin somehow protective against bleach? A second realization came when Liuâ€™s mother was nagging him about eating brightly colored vegetables. He remembered that many pigments have antioxidant properties. Maybe it was the pigment, and not the toxin, that was somehow protecting the bacteria. But why would Streptococcus evolve to produce pigment? It wouldnâ€™t be common for the bacteria to encounter cleaning products when they invaded bodies. The final flash of insight came when Liu read the back of the bleach bottle. The fancy chemical name for bleachâ€™s active ingredient is hypochlorite  â€”   one of the chemicals released by immune cells when they attack bacterial infections. Further experiments confirmed his hypothesis  â€”   Streptococcus was using pigment to neutralize the immune systemâ€™s hypochlorite. Liu had stumbled upon one of strepâ€™s secret weapons. 10. A LITERAL CASE OF ACCIDENTAL BRILLIANCE, Calden Carroll thought that his days as a chemistry graduate student at the University of Oregon were nearly done  â€”   his thesis was nearly complete. He believed he had created a molecule that would light up in the presence of chloride. Such a molecule would be useful to scientists studying cystic fibrosis, a disease that disrupts the movement of chloride across cell membranes. But when he tested his magic molecule, it failed spectacularly. Instead of highlighting chloride, it lit up whenever nitrate was present. A professor pointed out this failed marker could actually be really useful  â€”   not for medicine, perhaps, but for agriculture. Carroll patented his discovery and now has a company that builds nitrate sensors to help farmers fertilize their fields more efficiently. 11. VIRUSES IN GLASS HOUSES, Ken Stedman was searching for fossilized viruses  â€”   strains that might have become trapped in the mineral deposits of hot springs millions of years ago. Would these fossils survive in some recognizable form? To find out, Stedman made an artificial hot spring in his lab and filled it with modern viruses. Sure enough, the viruses quickly became coated with silica. But the results just looked like rocky blobs  â€”   there were no signs of the viruses, and no clues that could help him find fossils in the field. Stedman and a graduate student, Jim Laidler, wanted something to come out of their failed experiment, so they tested to see if the   viruses could still reproduce. They couldnâ€™t  â€”   the microbes were effectively dead. Then, a student accidentally left a solution of coated viruses out on the counter when he went home for the evening. Overnight, the silica  . The next morning, the viruses were working again. Further research showed the silica coating didnâ€™t only inactivate viruses in a reversible way it also protected them from drying out and dying in the heat. This technique might someday help deploy a very special group of viruses  â€”   the sort used in vaccines  â€”   in places that lack ready refrigeration. 12. LOVE BUG, Shelley Adamo was a biologist at Dalhousie University studying crickets  â€”   specifically, how they respond to stress. How do you stress out a cricket? Introduce it to a predator. One of Adamoâ€™s students had pet bearded dragons, and she brought them in to scare the crickets. One of the lizards had a virus that quickly infected the crickets. But it didnâ€™t make them sick, at least not at first. It made them very, very interested in mating. She had discovered what she calls a parasitic aphrodisiac  â€”   a virus that boosts an animalâ€™s libido, thereby increasing its own transmission.

Trumpâ€™s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, reiterated that the network hadnâ€™t treated Trump fairly, and the campaign would be having its own counterprogramming. Itâ€™s a maneuver that probably only works for someone like Trump  â€”   who can command media attention at will and stir reporters into a frenzy with a single tweet. And itâ€™s one that would only work in a   news cycle, social media saturated environment. The perfect storm.

Bush had a standout performance Reagan took heat in the state for his absence, and it was Bush who went on to narrowly win Iowa. Even Reaganâ€™s former staff members admit that was a mistake, giving Bush new momentum. â€We blew Iowa, and I take responsibility for that, because I should have insisted on having him in there more,â€ said Charlie Black, a veteran GOP campaign operative who was Reaganâ€™s Midwest political director. It was a mistake Reagan wouldnâ€™t make again. And later in New Hampshire, it was Reagan who insisted on having more candidates included in the Nashua Telegraph debate so he wouldnâ€™t be facing Bush solo  â€”   so much that he eventually funded the debate himself, leading to his memorable, â€I paid for this microphoneâ€ moment. Reagan won the Granite State, and, of course, the nomination and presidency. Reaganâ€™s initial skip was more a political calculation  â€”   and one he likely wouldnâ€™t have made in the current media environment. Trumpâ€™s move is different. â€I guess he feels heâ€™s still going to be the center of attention, but actually this reinforces some of the worst parts of his character,â€ said Black, who was also a senior adviser for John McCainâ€™s presidential bids. â€A lot of people like him, but the people who donâ€™t think heâ€™s arrogant. Itâ€™s all about him, and heâ€™d rather fight than participate.â€ McCain also seriously threatened to skip one of the presidential debates after the 2008 economic collapse. But that also reinforced a narrative about McCain that Barack Obamaâ€™s campaign was willing to push  â€”   that he couldnâ€™t handle doing more than one thing at a time, a    dig at McCainâ€™s age. Televised presidential debates didnâ€™t begin until 1960  â€”   where the infamous   between Democrat John F. Kennedy and Republican Richard Nixon reinforced stereotypes that would define the race. The young, telegenic Kennedy shone on TV compared to a harried, sweating and older Nixon. Kennedy would win the general. Four years later, though, President Lyndon B. Johnson, who took office after Kennedy was assassinated, was leading in the polls and feared a debate could actually damage him, so he refused to debate Republican nominee Barry Goldwater. In 1968, Democrat Hubert Humphrey wanted to debate Nixon, but still smarting from his poor performance against Kennedy, the GOP nominee refused. In his 1972   race, Nixon again wouldnâ€™t debate Democrat George McGovern. In 1976, Democrat Jimmy Carter and GOP President Gerald Ford would finally meet on the televised debate stage. And, for the most part, theyâ€™ve been a political mainstay each four years. In 1980, Carter wouldnâ€™t debate Reagan initially, because independent John Anderson was allowed in. But later, only the two major party candidates would meet. In both partiesâ€™ primary debates, sometimes candidates have skipped in the past  â€”   or werenâ€™t invited, as was the case with some GOP hopefuls this year with such a large field. In 2011, with GOP primary debates beginning earlier than ever, eventual nominee Mitt Romney skipped the cycleâ€™s first debate in South Carolina, but he hadnâ€™t officially announced for president yet. Coming less than a week before Iowa though, Trumpâ€™s boycott is different, and could also be perceived differently by voters. â€People who are supporting him already, theyâ€™re not going to move that much. But if you have an individual who may be on the edge of going with him, they might be turned off in a certain extent,â€ predicted University of Arkansas professor Patrick Stewart, who has been studying this cycleâ€™s GOP presidential debates. The decision gives his rivals free shots to attack the absent Trump  â€”   depriving him of a chance to defend himself on stage. â€For someone who relies on a very forceful argument, this could be problematic, especially because of the fact he looks like heâ€™s running away from the debate,â€ Stewart said. â€It opens up the opportunity for other candidates to take potshots at him, and he canâ€™t respond. One of his greatest strengths has been his ability to respond quickly.â€ But Schmidt, the Iowa political science professor, said it wonâ€™t change much on the ground  â€”   because Trump has been rewriting the rules all along. â€Trump combines two things  â€”   feeding to peopleâ€™s anger and anxiety, and he also feeds to peopleâ€™s desire for entertainment,â€ Schmidt said. â€Itâ€™s bread and circuses.â€"
206131,840,secondary,1,"         A small San Francisco clothing retailer has lodged a class action suit against Ivanka Trumpâ€™s brand, charging that it has an unfair business edge because President Trump, his daughter and his aides have leveraged the presidency to promote its products. Modern Appealing Clothing, a    upscale boutique, filed a claim last week in Superior Court of California against Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, arguing that the brandâ€™s sales â€œhave surged since the electionâ€ because it has exploited â€œthe power and prestige of the White House for personal gain. â€ Ivanka Trumpâ€™s company declined to comment. The lawsuit comes as Ivanka Trump expands her presence as an unpaid adviser to her father, gaining an office in the West Wing and seeking security clearance. The first daughter plans to serve as her fatherâ€™s â€œeyes and earsâ€ and offer him â€œher candid advice,â€ as well as focus on issues that affect women in the workplace, said Washington lawyer Jamie Gorelick, who is serving as her ethics adviser. White House officials said that even though she is not a federal employee, Ivanka Trump will voluntarily follow federal ethics rules. â€œIvanka has taken on several measures to promote high standards of ethical conduct,â€ press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. â€œEven though sheâ€™s not a federal employee, sheâ€™ll follow the restrictions that would apply if she were. Sheâ€™s taken these steps with the advice of counsel and in consultation of the Office of Government Ethics. â€ The daily management of her company, which Ivanka Trump solely owns, is being handled by president Abigail Klem. In addition, Ivanka Trump put a trust in charge of the business and prohibited the company from engaging in any agreements with foreign officials or   enterprises, according to Gorelick, who will advise both the trustees and Ivanka Trump on the implications of any new licensing deals or agreements the company is considering. Any foreign contracts will be closely reviewed, she said. Ivanka Trump will still have veto power over any new deals, an arrangement that gives her the ability to ward off potential conflicts, Gorelick added. â€œThis is new territory,â€ she said. â€œWe, in our advice to her, have tried to be very conservative and to limit in any way that we can think of the conflicts that might arise from her brand while she is helping her father. â€   [â€˜Go buy Ivankaâ€™s stuff,â€™ Kellyanne Conway said. Then the first daughterâ€™s fashion sales exploded.]   Still, ethics experts said Ivanka Trumpâ€™s formalized presence in the West Wing  â€”   even as she still owns and controls her eponymous brand  â€”   exacerbates the potential for conflicts of interest and intensifies questions about whether the White House is serving as a platform for her    label, which includes Ivanka   clothing and accessories. After the election, her company promoted in an email a $10, 000 bracelet that she wore during a â€60 Minutesâ€ interview. In February, President Trump lashed out on Twitter at Nordstrom after the department store decided to stop carrying Ivanka Trump products because of declining sales, complaining that his daughter â€œhas been treated so unfairly. â€ A few days later, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway used an appearance on â€œFox & Friendsâ€ to urge consumers to purchase Ivanka Trump products. â€œIâ€™m going to give a free commercial here,â€ Conway said. â€œGo buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. â€ Conwayâ€™s comments  â€”   which were followed by a spike in sales  â€”   appeared to violate a ban on federal employees using their positions to endorse products or services. The director of the Office of Government Ethics urged the White House to investigate the matter and discipline Conway, but the White House Counselâ€™s Office rebuffed that recommendation. Modern Appealing Clothing, a   retailer in San Francisco with two stores, cited the president and Conwayâ€™s comments in its lawsuit, accusing Ivanka Trumpâ€™s company of having an unfair advantage in the marketplace in part by â€œ  promotionâ€ of products â€œon appearances at executive branch and other governmental events. â€ The suit is similar to one filed this month by a Logan Circle wine bar against President Trump and his Washington hotel, alleging that his ownership of the Pennsylvania Avenue property is luring away customers and damaging the wine barâ€™s business. Norman Eisen, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama, said he expects other such suits to crop up. â€œNone of them is a layup, but I do think the courts are going to take them seriously,â€ he said, adding, â€œI do believe that the Trump family businesses are engaged in unfair competition. The ways in which the whole Trump family uses the White House and the presidency as the worldâ€™s greatest infomercial does strike me as unfair. â€ David Nakamura and Alice Crites contributed to this report."

The former Texas governor is the  â€™s pick to be energy secretary, and he had a relatively smooth hearing with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. But it was his humorous exchange with Sen. Al Franken that may be the most memorable of his testimony. The Minnesota Democrat began his questioning by thanking Perry for coming by to chat with him prior to his hearing. â€Thank you so much for coming into my office. Did you enjoy meeting me?â€ the former Saturday Night Live comedian deadpanned. â€I hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch,â€ Perry responded. It took a beat, but both Franken and Perry realized how that could be interpreted. â€May I rephrase that, sir?â€ Perry quipped, breaking down in laughter, as did the rest of the audience and senators in the usually serious hearing room. â€Well, I think weâ€™ve found our Saturday Night Live sound bite.â€ Itâ€™s not the first time Perry has provided fodder for comics. His first presidential bid in 2012 saw its demise after he infamously forgot the name of the third federal department he would want to eliminate as president. It was the Energy Department  â€”   the one he is now nominated to run. â€I canâ€™t, the third,â€ Perry finally conceded after stumbling for several seconds. â€Oops.â€ SNL had fun with that infamous moment. Perry made a second bid for president this cycle, but his campaign never got off the ground, and he dropped out before the primary voting even began. He did find something to do, though, before Trump offered him this current one  â€”   as a contestant on Dancing With The Stars. He wasnâ€™t successful in that either, but he did have a lot of fun doing it."

155979,848,tertiary,7,"As the Rolling Stonesâ€™ You Canâ€™t Always Get What You Want boomed over loudspeakers after Donald Trumpâ€™s rally in Kissimmee, Florida, on Thursday night, an elderly spectator walked by the media enclosure. â€œTraitor! Traitor! Youâ€™re guilty of treason, all of you!â€ he shouted, before giving journalists the middle finger. â€œUp yours! Pack your bags and get out of here!â€ He was far from alone in asserting that Trumpâ€™s recent mishaps  â€”   clashing with the parents of a fallen US army captain, hinting at the assassination of Hillary Clinton  â€”   and his dismal poll numbers were the product of a liberal media conspiracy. Their faith unshaken, the Republican nomineeâ€™s superfans cheered him with religious fervor and, when he lambasted the media, turned to boo with no less passion. As the Washington pundits and pollsters wrote them off, there was a sense of circling the wagons. But hours earlier, Trump had made a rare admission. â€œAt the end, itâ€™s either going to work or Iâ€™m going to, you know, Iâ€™m going to have a very, very nice long vacation,â€ he told CNBC. If, as every recent survey suggests, he does indeed suffer defeat, it raises the question of what will happen to the 13. 3 million people who voted for him in the Republican primaries and whether, ultimately, Trumpism can survive Trump. Several supporters at Thursdayâ€™s rally  â€”   where raucous crowds punched the air and chanted â€œLock her up!â€ and â€œLiar! Liar!â€  â€”   told the Guardian they believed that he would only lose the election if it were rigged. Should that happen, some said they intended to remain engaged in politics, but more likely with a third party than with the Republicans  â€”   especially if that party were to revert to establishment figures such as Jeb Bush. That would pose a dilemma for Republican elders seeking to rebuild from the ruins of a potential landslide defeat. â€œThe liberal media are trying to skewer the vote so we wonâ€™t go out and vote,â€ said Flora Reece, 47, a commercial analyst. â€œWe know heâ€™s going to win. We know heâ€™s going to be the next president of the United States. â€ And if he doesnâ€™t? Reece replied firmly: â€œThere will be dead people who voted,   people who voted. They bring immigrants here to vote for the Democratic party. The system is rigged. â€ Trumpâ€™s followers, who include many newcomers to politics, are not prepared to fade quietly into the background, added Reece, who is African American and a member of her local Republican party. â€œPeople are too mad and too angry. They used to be lackadaisical but they got involved and found out that if you become part of a movement, you can change things. â€œThe Republican establishment is bought and paid off. Right now you canâ€™t tell the difference between Democrat and Republican. Weâ€™ve already planned to start a new party to bring independents, Democrats and Republicans together and take the White House back in four years. â€ Melanie Parkham, 56, agreed: â€œDonald Trump has totally exposed how corrupt DC is. Iâ€™m sick of the Republicans too. Iâ€™ve heard a lot of people say theyâ€™re going to leave the Republican party. â€ Asked what would happen if Trump lost, Parkham replied: â€œHell, weâ€™ll know Hillary Clinton had it rigged. Iâ€™ll switch to independent. I have friends in their 40s and 60s who have registered to vote for the first time in their lives so they can vote for Trump. Iâ€™ll make sure they stay interested. â€ Trumpâ€™s   tribulations just prompted Time magazine to publish a stylised image of his head dribbling like hot wax beside a single word headline: â€œMeltdownâ€. After his unwinnable fight with gold star family Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son died serving in Iraq, the candidate attempted to restore discipline last Monday with a major economic speech in Detroit"
155979,849,tertiary,359,"Yet by Wednesday, he had touched off another furore with an    comment widely seen as inciting supporters of the second amendment to assassinate Clinton. A day later, he began repeatedly describing Barack Obama as â€œthe founderâ€ of Islamic State. He finally walked that back in the early hours of Friday morning. As several polls showed the Democrat leading by double digits and beginning to threaten in red states such as Arizona, South Carolina and Utah  â€”   her campaign is even prodding Texas  â€”   more and more Republicans scrambled for the last lifeboats on the Titanic. Yet in Trump World, the prevailing narratives do not apply. Some supporters, for example, opined that Khizr Khan had been paid $375, 000 to denounce Trump  â€”   an unproven claim perpetrated by rightwing websites  â€”   and was therefore fair game. Capt Terry Shields, 66, a war veteran who served in Vietnam in   said: â€œIt was a shame it was brought up by the father in the first place. I think it was a fixed deal. The biggest thing that worries me is the Muslims taking over. Itâ€™s obvious that Obama is pushing them. â€ Similarly, Trumpâ€™s comment about the second amendment was â€œall twistedâ€ by the media, he added, a view echoed by many at the rally in Florida, a critical swing state"
155979,850,primary,302,"Trumpâ€™s support base is, of course, no more a monolithic bloc than any other section of the electorate. Generalisations are perilous and pose a headache for   Republican strategists. Another military veteran, Brett Puffenbarger, 29, said: â€œI jumped on Trump train fairly early on. He was the only GOP candidate who wasnâ€™t outright against gay marriage and legalisation of marijuana. He was socially liberal and fiscally conservative and that was a big draw for me. â€ Sabrina Motes, 36, said: â€œIâ€™m a Jewish American, I used to be a Democrat and Iâ€™m college educated. I hate the stereotype that if youâ€™re college educated or Jewish you donâ€™t support Trump. Iâ€™ve followed him in his business career and I believe heâ€™s what the country needs right now. â€ But looking to the future, Motes, a pharmaceutical sales rep, added: â€œI donâ€™t think Trump is the perfect candidate. There are things that can be learned from and things that could be done differently. Republicans were supposed to learn from Mitt Romney but I donâ€™t think they did. â€ Allegations of rigging were widespread, even though a vote has not yet been cast, but few were willing to predict what kind of backlash there would be. Bob Kunst, 74, a registered but disaffected Democrat sitting behind a cardboard â€œTrump v Trampâ€ sign, said: â€œRight now the anger is intense and if, God forbid, Trump loses, youâ€™re talking revolution. Youâ€™ve just had a revolution in Britain with Brexit. â€ But Charlie van Esler, 60, an investment products seller who supported Marco Rubio in the primaries, said: â€œI have no reason to believe it would be a rigged election. I respect the democratic process. The idea that Trump supporters are rednecks and yahoos is disingenuous. â€ Outside the arena, where Trump addressed thousands of (nearly all white) supporters, badges, hats,   and other merchandise were on sale. The Confederate flag was flying outside a stall run by Ariel Robb, a    nurse, who insisted that its message â€œis more heritage than hateâ€. Trump claims that he has brought millions of new people to the Republican party Robb is one of them. â€œHe is the only candidate Iâ€™ve taken an interest in over the years,â€ she said. â€œHeâ€™s the only candidate who says if he makes a mess, heâ€™ll clean it up. Heâ€™s a really intelligent man  â€”   and anythingâ€™s better than Hillary. I donâ€™t think heâ€™s going to lose and, if he does, I think Hillary will be impeached in the first week she gets in office. â€ Meanwhile, Kelly Steele, 52, was shouting: â€œGet your â€˜Make America Great Againâ€™ hats and lapel pins, USA made!â€ echoing the debate over   manufacturing versus global trade. â€œIf he loses, Iâ€™m not looking to a man or woman to run this country. Iâ€™m trusting in God. â€ Whereas Trump has a luxury home in Florida and beat local senator Rubio in the primaries, he fared less well in states such as Wisconsin. Earlier this week in Janesville, where   melancholy is evident in a closed car plant and eerily quiet downtown, House speaker Paul Ryan crushed a   challenger in a congressional primary. It was an important victory for the partyâ€™s establishment wing, which continues to battle   conservatives for Republican seats across the country, with mixed results. Analysts dismiss the idea that, should Trump lose, a new wave of candidates will seek to emulate him in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. Heather Cox Richardson, an academic at Boston College and historian of the Republican party, said: â€œDonald Trumpâ€™s racist and xenophobic supporters are going to break off and do   violence. The Republican party is going to go into a far more progressive direction, back to the party of Nelson Rockefeller, Dwight Eisenhower and Teddy Roosevelt. â€œItâ€™s a reinvention theyâ€™ve done before. The Trump supporters who are motivated by economic factors will gravitate back in a heartbeat. The idea that a party is going to win again by tying itself to voters over 65 is suicidal. Hanging on to this man is suicidal. What surprises me is how many people in the Republican party think their fortunes would be worse if they renounced him. I think people who havenâ€™t, like Paul Ryan, are done. â€ The Republicans could become the first party to lose the White House for three consecutive elections since the Democrats in 1988. A leading architect of the Democratic revival was Al From, who said on Thursday: â€œFirst the Republicans have got to develop an agenda that people want to vote for, not just a small sliver of the electorate. â€œTheyâ€™ve got to become more libertarian on cultural issues to appeal to young voters. You have to express views in ways that convey youâ€™re open to other points of views, too. We werenâ€™t going to win   voters in 1992 but they saw Bill Clinton and said: â€˜Heâ€™s not a radical on this, letâ€™s look at what he says about other issues. â€™â€ From warned: â€œIf the governors and party leaders donâ€™t take a stronger hand in shaping the party, itâ€™s possible there will be some sort of replacement party. There could be a realignment of the parties over the next two or three elections. With the Republicans itâ€™s more extreme because Trump has hijacked the party from the leadership. The leaders could take it back but itâ€™s possible a third party could emerge. â€ That argument echoes the recommendations of a Republican autopsy report, conducted after the 2012 election defeat, which called for wider appeal to young people and racial minorities and an end to the partyâ€™s   stance. First the party could not bring itself to make that journey by passing a law in Congress  â€”   then Trump came along with his signature plan to build a wall. Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant and pollster, also doubts that the maverick tycoon will have a   political legacy. He said: â€œTrump has little formal statewide organisation  â€”   even now. He has loyalists, but they are disorganised. His campaign is being   and outspent by ratios we have never seen in modern politics  â€”   and thatâ€™s with just 90 days to go. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that this movement will continue beyond its leader. He has become the most unpopular political figure in America today. â€ It would be foolish to write the Republican party off, Luntz added. â€œThe GOP has been through these rough elections before, and they have emerged stronger and more unified much more quickly than prognosticators ever expected. The Goldwater debacle in 1964 led to Nixonâ€™s resurgence in 1968 and a 60% landslide in 1972. â€œWatergate may have destroyed the GOP in 1974, but Reagan won by nine [percentage points] just six years later and by 20 [points] four years after that. The loss of George Herbert Walker Bush in 1992 was supposed to be the end of the GOP, but they won the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years just two years later. Republicans are a very resilient party, and it doesnâ€™t take long for them to recover. â€"
168784,851,tertiary,101,"At first glance, real estate agent Theresa Mondaleâ€™s listings donâ€™t sound too different from those of other agents trying to sell a piece of Montana paradise: 270 acres at the base of the Bitterroot Mountains completely surrounded by U. S. Forest Service land, stands of old growth fir and cedar trees, a spring with pure water. Only when you read on do you discover this isnâ€™t your average vacation cabin. One listing boasts of a modified bunker with a â€very secureâ€ iron locking door on the property and a root cellar that could be turned into an alternative living situation. Another one mentions a yard with space to land a helicopter â€if the need is there.â€ Welcome to the world of sustainable, survivalist real estate. Thereâ€™s a growing market for this kind of   property. Mondale figures over the past six to eight years, sales of these survivalist properties have risen by 50 percent. â€It seems like over the past few years, thereâ€™s just this need, I donâ€™t want to say panic or frantic, but people feeling the need to be able to have someplace to go,â€ Mondale says. A lot of Mondaleâ€™s clients are worried about some pretty heavy things, and theyâ€™re looking for places that are advertised as defendable. â€Whether itâ€™s the fiat money system finally coming down, societal collapse, global warming causing flooding,â€ Mondale says. Sheâ€™s heard pretty much every reason, and she doesnâ€™t question her clients. Sheâ€™s just here to help them find the right fit. Despite the remoteness of these homes, theyâ€™re not backwoods shacks with sagging metal roofs. Some of her listings sell for more than $1 million if thereâ€™s a lot of land and if water rights are included. The one with the helicopter pad is a spiffy,   log home with a wraparound porch. It has solar panels and inside, a backup generator, luxury bathrooms and a kitchen with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances. â€Just because youâ€™re   or being sustainable doesnâ€™t mean you have to be looking like the old hick miner,â€ she says, laughing, â€with grass on your roof or whatever. You can do anything.â€ In the 1990s, the remote Montana mountains developed a reputation as an enclave for Y2K worriers, doomsday cults and the Unabomber. The state still gets made fun of a lot. Mondale is sensitive to this. One of her current listings was previously owned by one of those doomsday cults, but, she says, whatâ€™s going on today is different. People want to be more   less dependent on the outside, grow their own food, that kind of thing. â€These are not crazy people,â€ she says. Mondale and her husband donâ€™t just sell this lifestyle. They live it, too. They consider themselves â€preppers.â€ Inside one of their garages is 1, 200 pounds of meat they either raised or hunted. There are canned beets from their garden, tomatoes, zucchini and garlic. They even make their own garlic powder. Tim Mondale is a general contractor who builds bunkers and secret rooms for these types of properties. â€We still work, we have normal jobs, and we save our money but we just protect ourselves differently than a lot of people that live in the big cities,â€ he says.

211705,852,secondary,104,"     No one who has been paying attention to the GOP presidential race for the past couple of weeks can be surprised that Donald Trump scored a huge victory Tuesday night, prompting Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) to get out of the race. That his big win occurred on the same day as his insane accusation that Cruzâ€™s father was involved with JFKâ€™s assassination confirms the sense of many principled conservatives that the electorate has blown it and failed to discern that Trump is unfit, if not unstable, for any office, let alone the presidency. â€œWhile tonightâ€™s Indiana primary results increased Donald Trumpâ€™s delegate count, Trump remains short of the 1, 237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination,â€ the Our Principles PACâ€™s founder Katie Packer said in a written statement. â€œA substantial number of delegates remain up for grabs in this highly unpredictable year. In addition, there is more than a month before the California primary  â€”   more time for Trump to continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters, as he did yet again today spreading absurd tabloid lies about Ted Cruzâ€™s father and the JFK assassination. â€ She continued, â€œWe continue to give voice to the belief of so many Republicans that Trump is not a conservative, does not represent the values of the Republican Party, cannot beat Hillary Clinton, and is simply unfit to be President of the United States. â€ She vowed, â€œWe will continue to educate voters about Trump until he, or another candidate, wins the support of a majority of delegates to the Convention. â€ While technically true, many Republicans now must come to terms with the need for a conservative who does represent the values of an outfit previously called the Republican Party. Republicans should keep in mind several points. First, insofar as Trump is almost certainly going to be clobbered in the general election it is no excuse to say a third candidate would hand the race to Hillary Clinton. She has it in the bag, barring a cataclysmic event. A third candidate is a political necessity to turn out voters for   Republicans, but more important, a moral necessity that disentangles conservatives from Trump and his noxious ideas"

(Victoria   Washington Post)   Second, when former candidates like Bobby Jindal say they will vote for Trump (but not be happy about it!) and when TV media entertainer Sean Hannity allows Trump without challenge to repeat his despicable lie about Cruzâ€™s father, responsible Republicans must conclude that there needs to be a separation between those who put stock in personal character and truthfulness and those who do not; between those who babble inanities and those who insist on intellectual rigor; between those who lack simple decency and respect for fellow Americans and those who believe our political system must function without threat of violence, bigoted slurs and lies. The dividing line is now crystal clear. To one side stands an angry nativist mob and to the other men and women of decent character and honorable purpose. Choose sides. You cannot be in both camps. And if you claim to be bound by â€œparty loyaltyâ€ to support Trump, there will be scores who will refuse to be in the same party. Third, the idea  â€”  still  â€”   that â€œestablishmentâ€ Republicans gave us Trump suggests some Republicans simply do not get it. Jeb Bush, Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) moderate think tankers and advocates of responsible immigration reform  â€”   to name just a few  â€”   have fought Trump tooth and nail from the beginning. While Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham, Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) Freedom Caucus fans and others in the far right swamp backed Trump staunchly (or when it mattered most, before hedging their bets). Letâ€™s can the chatter about â€œRepublican establishmentâ€ vs. the grass roots; if anything the â€œgrass rootsâ€ voted for Trump by the millions. Finally, there have been and will continue to be efforts to find an alternative candidate to Trump and Clinton. Honorable men and women who find Trumpism repugnant and are willing to step into the fray should be commended regardless of the electionâ€™s outcome. They will have a ready answer to the question: What did you do to stop Trump?"

202238,856,primary,13," Spiro P. â€™s Yelp review of the Louvre, posted in 2010, seems like artistic blasphemy. But in some ways, the disappointment is familiar to anybody whoâ€™s been there:     The curator of the Louvre should take down all the â€Mona Lisaâ€ signs and promote other works"
202238,857,primary,129,The â€Mona Lisaâ€ is a painting of status and nothing more
202238,858,tertiary,124,So Spiro P. didnâ€™t like it. Is there at least a cynicâ€™s case for the â€Mona Lisaâ€™sâ€ fame? Why did she become the most famous painting in the world while other pieces fail to excite the worldâ€™s coffee mug makers? YouTube is filled with videos that assess the artistic uniqueness of Leonardo da Vinciâ€™s painting. But if you find the â€Mona Lisaâ€ underwhelming  â€”   or the critical analyses unconvincing  â€”   her fame can seem as enigmatic as her legendary smile (and phrases like â€legendary smileâ€ might make you roll your eyes)
202238,859,secondary,120,"  As the above video shows, there is a logical case for just how Mona became . .. Mona. And the story involves one surprisingly influential critic and a theft"
202238,860,secondary,171,"  A largely forgotten critic made â€Mona Lisaâ€ a star          Walter Pater, critic"
202238,861,tertiary,151,"Many writers have chronicled the exciting and infamous story of how Vincenzo Peruggia stole the â€Mona Lisaâ€ in 1911. (This Smithsonian piece is particularly vivid.) But why did Peruggia target the â€Mona Lisaâ€ in the first place? The answer might lie with a critic named Walter Pater (1839 â€”  1894). Pater was an influential English critic and scholar who defined the Renaissance for his Victorian audience, chiefly in the book of the same name (which you can read here). That book had a breakout hit: Paterâ€™s essay on the â€Mona Lisa,â€ which is a gloriously overblown ode to the painting. Hereâ€™s the overstuffed paragraph at the center of it (you may want to just skim it; he compares Mona to an eternal vampire):     She is older than the rocks among which she sits like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants: and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern thought has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life"
202238,862,primary,64,"This is sickly sweet writing, but people loved it  â€”   Oscar Wilde praised the writing, and generations of writers followed Paterâ€™s lead, including famed French critics like Hippolyte Taine. But for many   readers, Paterâ€™s description of â€Mona Lisaâ€ became iconic. His work spread and elevated â€Mona Lisaâ€ in the pantheon. References to Paterâ€™s work popped up in guidebooks to the Louvre and reading clubs in Paducah. When Mona was recovered after the robbery, publications like the New York Times referenced Paterâ€™s essay, and it showed up in Paterâ€™s 1894 obituary"
202238,863,secondary,102,"  But while Paterâ€™s essay established â€Mona Lisaâ€ as a notable work in the art world, she didnâ€™t immediately become the iconic, memeable, inescapable icon we know today. An 1880 piece about the Louvre gave more attention to da Vinciâ€™s other masterpiece â€The Last Supper,â€ as did a 1900 guidebook about the Louvre. In 1907, a vandal targeted a picture by Ingres, not the â€Mona Lisa,â€ and in 1910 another article called her just the Louvreâ€™s second most famous painting. Thereâ€™s no doubt that Mona was famous by the 1900s, thanks in large part to Pater. By the late 1800s, speculation about the subjectâ€™s enigmatic smile was common. Even conspiracy theories emerged in the 1900s, when people speculated sheâ€™d secretly been taken to America. That chatter was paired with real precautions  â€”   after the Ingres slashing, Mona was put under glass just in case another vandal went on the offensive. But despite the occasional riff on Monaâ€™s appearance (or mystifying popularity) she didnâ€™t clearly own the title of worldâ€™s most famous painting. Pater gave Mona a platform  â€”   and a man named Vincenzo Peruggia took her from it. A thief made â€Mona Lisaâ€ a legend             The August 21, 1911, theft of the â€Mona Lisaâ€ has spawned its own mythology. (Those looking to dive deep can check out documentaries like Mona Lisa Is Missing.) But the surface story is simple: Former Louvre employee Peruggia wanted to restore the â€Mona Lisaâ€ to her native Italy. He said it was a matter of national pride (though it seems like profit was a pretty good motive, too). So he went into the Louvre, hid, and snuck the painting out underneath his coat after the museum had closed. It took a day for the Louvre to even notice, and for two years Peruggia kept the painting before being caught when trying to unload it on a gallery in Florence. The intervening manhunt and press fervor served as a giant ad campaign for the painting. Suddenly, a notable but not universally known painting was the subject of excited headlines and ecstatic copy (which often referenced Pater). People couldnâ€™t necessarily see the â€Mona Lisaâ€ while it was hiding in Peruggiaâ€™s apartment, but they could easily read about how it was the greatest painting ever made"
202238,864,secondary,221,"  Art fans and the general public became equally aware of Monaâ€™s missing smile. The New York Times used the painting as a linchpin for a history of all stolen art, it published a 1900s take on fanfiction in which two authors speculated how they would have stolen â€Mona Lisa,â€ and the paper of record even printed conspiracy theories that Mona had never been stolen at all. When she did return to the Louvre in 1914  â€”   after a brief show in Florence  â€”   Mona had gone from art fan highlight to worldwide heroine. The painting appeared splashed on front pages and became the instant subject of parodies and, of course, more prose. Thanks to Paterâ€™s prolix, but beloved, essay, an art thief with a daring plan, and a media happy to publicize Monaâ€™s unexpected journey, da Vinciâ€™s portrait became something bigger than a piece of art  â€”   it became Art itself for a great number of people. The cynicâ€™s case for the â€Mona Lisaâ€ This case for the â€Mona Lisaâ€™sâ€ ubiquity as a result of overblown criticism,   newspapers, and theft is one that seems to ignore the virtues of the painting. Today, she feels like something from a postmodern novel  â€”   a painting thatâ€™s famous for being famous. But really, that cynical perspective can work in tandem with a dreamier take on the portraitâ€™s charms. The things that made Mona so appealing to Pater, Peruggia, and the press are the things that make her appealing to aesthetically minded art fans  â€”   a sense of mystery, an indefinable mood, and a timelessness unbound by da Vinciâ€™s period. And thatâ€™s the only way she can live up to the expectations of Yelpers like Spiro P"

156862,867,primary,30,"Canada regularly detains hundreds of children who have run afoul of the countryâ€™s immigration laws  â€”   including some who are held in correctional facilities and even in solitary confinement, according to a new report calling for sweeping reforms to the practice. Between 2010 and 2014, an average of 242 children were detained across Canada over immigration violations, according to the International Human Rights Program at the University of Toronto. Their report, released on Thursday, sheds light on these detentions, which range in length from days to several months, and calls for urgent reform to a Canadian practice that has attracted consistent criticism from the United Nations"
156862,868,secondary,50,"â€œWhatâ€™s happening with children in detention really runs counter to the narrative of Canada as a global human rights promoter,â€ said Samer Muscati, the reportâ€™s editor. â€œCanada has signed international agreements, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which clearly states that any detention has to be done as a last resort and for the least amount of time possible. â€ The practice of regularly detaining children is among the many issues that plague Canadaâ€™s immigration detention system. Across the country, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has the power to detain   deemed to be a flight risk, who pose a threat to public safety or whose identities cannot be confirmed"
156862,869,tertiary,99,"A lack of transparency and oversight mars the system, resulting in what critics have described as a â€œlegal black holeâ€. Since 2000, at least 15 people have died in the custody of the CBSA, including five who are thought to have died from natural causes and three by suicide. Six deaths remain attributed to unknown causes"
156862,870,tertiary,22,"Thursdayâ€™s report focuses on the children  â€”   ranging from newborns to teenagers  â€”   ensnared in the same system. Some are formally detained. Others are Canadian citizens who are forced to choose between separating from parents who have been detained by immigration authorities or living in detention with their parents as de facto detainees. Those who stay with their parents still face family separation, in that they are held with their mother and have limited visits during the day with their father"
156862,871,primary,175,"The figures in the report probably underestimate the scale of the issue, said Muscati, as the data mostly reflects children who are formally detained. â€œWe still donâ€™t have an accurate number or idea of how many children are informally detained. â€ Those detained hail from around the world with children from   Africa making up the largest group, at 23% of the children detained. The average length of detention is 10 days for children who are formally detained. For those who are held informally with their parents, the average length of the detention stretches to nearly 30 days. â€œBecause under the law theyâ€™re invisible, their interests arenâ€™t identified and represented,â€ said Muscati. â€œSo they actually languish in these facilities for longer periods of time than formally detained children. â€  Most children are held in   immigration holding centres. But a small number have wound up in correctional facilities or police stations across the country"
156862,872,primary,157,"The report also flagged what Muscati called â€œa whole other, really horrible scenarioâ€ referring to findings on the use of solitary confinement for two, unaccompanied    boys. One of them  â€”   a Syrian boy who had attempted to claim refugee status after entering Canada from the US  â€”   was left in isolation for three weeks. Loath to put the young males in the womenâ€™s section and worried that they may be at risk in the menâ€™s section, authorities chose to place them in solitary confinement"
156862,873,tertiary,247,"Even just a few days in detention can cause serious and   psychological harm to children. Studies have shown children who are detained experience increased symptoms of   stress, anxiety and depression, and are more likely to contemplate suicide. These symptoms often persist long after the children are released"
156862,874,primary,244,"As less than 2% of those detained are considered a threat to public safety, the report highlights alternatives, such as those used in Sweden and Hong Kong, which allow children to reside with their families in the community through the use of reporting obligations, financial deposits and guarantees, or electronic monitoring"
156862,875,secondary,84,"Responding to the report, the CBSA said it was aware of the issue and said â€œtangible stepsâ€ are in the works to address the situation. The agency said it has been working to â€œreset the immigration detention programâ€ to increase the use of alternatives and eliminate the detention of minors, except in the most limited and exceptional circumstances. The agency falls under the portfolio of Canadaâ€™s public safety ministry. In a statement to the Guardian, the office of Ralph Goodale, Canadaâ€™s public safety minister, noted that the minister has been clear about wanting to try to avoid housing children in detention facilities, â€œas much as humanly possible. â€ The agency plans to expand alternatives to detention and will begin publishing statistics on immigration detention in the near future. â€œAs well, additional mental health training for staff at Immigration Holding Centres has already begun. â€  Their efforts were noted by those behind the report, who said that recent months have seen a decline in the number of children taken into custody"
156862,876,secondary,52,"â€œAfter years of silence and inaction, the Canadian government and CBSA are taking serious steps that will hopefully bring us closer to ending child detention and family separation,â€ said Hanna Gros, one of the reportâ€™s  . â€œBut Ottawa needs to move quickly and deliberately to end the needless suffering of children and their parents. â€"
184564,877,tertiary,176," Nestle ( ) plans to buy back as much as 20 billion Swiss francs ($20. 8 billion) worth of shares over three years, it said on Tuesday, days after U. S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC began a campaign to boost performance at the company. The New   hedge fund, controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, disclosed a $3. 5 billion stake in the company on Sunday when it started pushing for Nestle to more aggressively boost performance and buy back shares. Nestle, maker of Gerber baby food and Perrier water, said its announcement was the result of a review of its priorities that had begun in early 2017. It did not mention Third Point in its statement, and Third Point declined to comment on the announcement. However, Nestleâ€™s Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who took over at the start of the year, said at the companyâ€™s   results presentation in April that he understood from meetings with shareholders they wanted to see â€meaningful steps towards improved combinations of growth rates and marginsâ€. These comments and the fact that buyback plans take time to get regulatory approval before being announced mean that Nestle would have submitted the plan before Third Point made its position public late on Sunday"
184564,878,tertiary,58,"Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said there was no big surprise in the companyâ€™s statement, but it had initially planned to release this at its investor day in September. It was not clear, however, whether feedback that Loeb might have given in a meeting earlier this month was taken into consideration when Nestle crafted the final buyback plan, which will start on July 4"
184564,879,primary,138,"Vontobel analyst   Bertschy did not see the announcement as a direct result of Third Point. â€We rather see todayâ€™s announcement as a thorough strategic review triggered by CEO Mark Schneider, approved by the board,â€ he said, noting that this was Nestleâ€™s   buyback following 25 billion Swiss francs in 2007. The company has bought back 47 billion francs worth of shares since 2005. â€In the context of low interest rates and strong cash flow generation, share buybacks offer a viable option to create shareholder value,â€ the company said. The volume of monthly share buybacks will depend on market conditions but will probably occur mostly in 2019 and 2020, so Nestle can consider acquisitions before then, it said"
184564,880,tertiary,63,"    The company now expects to increase its level of debt to about 1. 5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by 2020. That would be up from about 0. 8 times last year"
184564,881,tertiary,165,"HOPES OF CHANGE  Nestle shares had jumped 4 percent on Monday, adding some $10 billion in market value before falling 1. 6 percent on Tuesday, on hopes the push by Third Point would speed up changes under Schneider, who joined the company last year and took over as CEO in January. On Tuesday, Nestle said it will focus any capital spending on   food and beverage categories including coffee, petcare, infant nutrition and bottled water, as well as growth opportunities in consumer healthcare. It said this monthâ€™s announcement that it may sell its U. S. confectionery business was consistent with that approach. It also recently formed a joint venture with R&R Ice Cream to manage its ice cream business"
184564,882,tertiary,132," â€The company will continue to adjust its portfolio in line with its strategy and growth objectives,â€ Nestle said. There are other parts of Nestleâ€™s business that analysts have speculated could be sold, including its U. S. frozen food business. Billions of dollars worth of assets are up for grabs as the global packaged food industry adapts to change. For example, Unilever ( ) is selling its margarine and spreads business and Reckitt Benckiser ( ) is selling its mustard business. Keplerâ€™s Cox said the fact that the company said it was targeting spending in consumer healthcare meant â€it could be seen on the prowl for assets like Johnson and Johnsonâ€™s consumer health as well as Bayerâ€™s consumer health businessâ€. TOO BIG TO SHAKE?   The pressure placed on the worldâ€™s largest food group, Europeâ€™s most valuable company, shatters perceptions that the Swiss giant with over 2, 000 brands is too big to shake up. CEO Schneider, who had met Loeb this month, seemed to hint at that last week when he told a conference in Berlin: â€Size alone does not protect you from the winds of change.â€ Coupled with a shock $143 billion takeover bid from Kraft Heinz for Unilever in February, it shows the impatience of some investors about how multinationals are adapting to change. Loeb, who has taken on giants such as Yahoo and Sony ( ) has argued that even though Nestle has exposure to promising categories such as coffee and pet food, its shares have underperformed rivals in recent years as it has â€remained stuck in its old waysâ€. â€It is rare to find a business of Nestleâ€™s quality with so many avenues for improvement,â€ Loeb said in the letter to the fundâ€™s investors"
184564,883,primary,48,"Nestle should set a target for margin growth to improve productivity, double its leverage to fund share buybacks, shed   assets and sell the 23 percent stake it owns in French cosmetics group Lâ€™Oreal ( ) he said. Whereas Unilever and Danone have recently set margin targets for 2020, Nestle has not. It has announced a productivity program to save 1. 8 billion Swiss francs by 2020, but has not yet said how much of that would fall to the bottom line. Analysts have said that Schneider, who will lay out his strategy at an investor event in September, had already seemed more open to listening to the concerns of longtime shareholders, many of which were echoed by Third Point"
184564,884,tertiary,94," Daniel Hauselmann, head of Swiss equities at GAM Investment Management, said much of what Third Point suggested was already being done"
184564,885,secondary,168,"â€Nestle is no sleeping giant that does not look after its shareholders,â€ he told Reuters. â€I think Nestle should stick to its strategy.â€ ($1 = 0. 9618 Swiss francs)  (Additional reporting by John Miller and Angelika Gruber in Zurich and Michael Flaherty in New York) LONDON British online grocer Ocado has seen a   in enquiries from U.

181827,886,primary,175," President Donald Trumpâ€™s effort to roll back Obamacare gained momentum on Wednesday as Republican leaders scheduled a vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday on newly revised legislation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy expressed confidence the bill would pass and several moderate Republican lawmakers who previously objected to the bill said they could now support it. A vote was expected as early as midday Thursday, with lawmakers planning to leave town later that day for a   recess. Late on Wednesday, the bill cleared a procedural step allowing it to advance to the House floor. Even if a narrow majority in the House approves the bill, it still faces a steep climb in the Senate, where only a few defections could kill the effort. Keen to score his first major legislative win since taking office in January, Trump threw his own political capital behind the bill, meeting with lawmakers and calling them in an effort to cajole their support. Trump, whose Republican party controls both the House and Senate, is seeking to make good on his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Aides said he worked the phones furiously. Wavering moderate Republicans had worried that the  legislation to overhaul President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2010 signature healthcare law would leave too many people with   medical conditions unable to afford health coverage. But several Republican skeptics got behind the bill after they met with Trump to float a compromise proposal that is still expected to face unanimous Democratic opposition. The legislationâ€™s prospects brightened further after members of the Freedom Caucus, a faction of conservative lawmakers in the House who played a key role in derailing the original version of the bill last month, said they could go along with the compromise. The bill is also receiving a torrent of opposition from medical groups, including the American Medical Association, who say millions of Americans will lose coverage or face higher costs. Millions more Americans got healthcare coverage under Obamacare, but Republicans have long attacked it. They view it as a government intrusion into the healthcare system and blame it for driving up costs. Called the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes, including a penalty for not buying health insurance. It would slash funding for Medicaid, the program that provides insurance for the poor, and roll back much of Medicaidâ€™s expansion"
181827,887,secondary,10,"The latest effort comes after earlier pushes by Trump for healthcare reform collapsed twice, underscoring the difficulty of rallying together the Republican partyâ€™s divided factions. Earlier this week, prospects for the legislation appeared grim as several influential moderate Republicans said they could not support the bill, citing their concerns about protecting people with   conditions. Putting a spotlight on the concerns about   conditions,   talk show host Jimmy Kimmel made a tearful plea for keeping that provision in Obamacare as he recounted a medical emergency that arose with his newborn son"
181827,888,tertiary,179," Kimmelâ€™s monologue about his sonâ€™s congenital heart condition was viewed nearly 19 million times on his showâ€™s Facebook page and on Wednesday morning was the No. 1 trending story on YouTube. Republican Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long, who were part of a group of moderate lawmakers who met at the White House with Trump, said the president endorsed their plan to add $8 billion over five years to help cover the cost for people with   illnesses who could otherwise be priced out of insurance markets. Describing Trumpâ€™s efforts to secure his support, Long said Trump told him: â€â€™Billy we really need you, man. â€™â€ Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the new language on   conditions was a â€net plusâ€ for garnering the votes needed to pass the healthcare bill. Critics of the changes to the law, including several health policy experts, said the $8 billion could not be enough to cover the cost of coverage for the sickest patients. Republicans did not await a new score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to see how many people would be insured under their revised plan and how much it would cost. UNCERTAINTY FOR STOCKS Health insurers, such as Anthem Inc ( ) UnitedHealth Group Inc ( ) Aetna Inc ( ) and Cigna Corp ( ) have faced months of uncertainty over healthcareâ€™s future. So have hospital companies, such as HCA Holdings Inc ( ) and Tenet Healthcare Corp ( ). On Wednesday, Aetna said it will exit the Obamacare individual insurance market in Virginia next year, citing â€growing uncertaintyâ€ and expected losses this year. House Democrats rejected the latest change to the Republican legislation on Wednesday, saying patients with   illnesses would be vulnerable to being pushed off their insurance in certain states and face higher costs"
181827,889,primary,201,"â€This is deadly,â€ House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told a news conference. â€No   will fix it.â€  Democrats have long thought their best chance of stopping the repeal would be in the Senate, where only a few Republicans would need to defect to stop the law from moving forward.

To inspire you, the NPR Ed Team called up leaders and designers at 10 of the nationâ€™s best childrenâ€™s museums and asked them one simple question: Whatâ€™s the one thing under your roof (or maybe out back) that kids and their   love to     the most? Here are their answers, our summer â€playlist.â€ 1. Adventure Expeditions  â€”   Port Discovery Childrenâ€™s Museum, Baltimore. This interactive exhibit doesnâ€™t just shake the dust off the traditional childrenâ€™s museum experience. It adds dust and creates an   mummy hunt for a new generation of kids whoâ€™ve never had the pleasure of watching Indiana Jones tumble through cobwebs and cobras. The adventure begins with a bit of time travel, transporting kids back to 1920s Egypt, where theyâ€™re charged with finding the lost tomb of a pharaoh. Along the way, they have to cross the roiling Nile, decipher hieroglyphs, choose wisely among the tombâ€™s dead ends and come    with the greatest dead end of all: whatâ€™s left of the mighty Nefrehotep. Nora Thompson, Port Discoveryâ€™s director of education and community enrichment, says the exhibit came out of conversations the museum had with an advisory council of kids. When asked what theyâ€™d like to see in a childrenâ€™s museum, Thompson says, â€one of the things that came up was a   experience. They wanted to play, to move  â€”   an adventure!â€ 2. The Hodge Podge Mahal  â€”   Madison Childrenâ€™s Museum, Madison, Wis. The Taj Mahal of play, this   structure allows children to climb through a maze of magically odd, reclaimed objects, including an old car, a wooden orb and a buoy from Lake Michigan. One reason itâ€™s so popular with kids, says Brenda Baker, director of exhibits, is that it feels a bit dangerous. â€Thereâ€™s a huge element of risk because youâ€™re climbing, and you donâ€™t really know where youâ€™re going to come out. It feels like it could be unsafe, but it isnâ€™t,â€ Baker says. â€Feeling like youâ€™re testing yourself is what makes it fun for kids  â€”   because they want to push themselves.â€ 3. Creativity Jam  â€”   Minnesota Childrenâ€™s Museum, St. Paul. With a big renovation pending, museum leaders wanted to prototype a few new exhibit ideas last year, then use kidsâ€™ feedback to make them even better. â€Creativity Jamâ€ includes a maker space with paints and power tools and a series of cabinets that kids can explore, full of strange artifacts:   brushes, sea glass, a typewriter, old cameras, etc. But what caught our attention was how beautifully the museumâ€™s muralist, Jessica Sigafoos, brought to life a game we all played as kids: The Lava Jump. As you can see, instead of leaping from one sofa cushion to the next while Mom or Dad calls you to dinner (now, or thereâ€™ll be no dessert) here kids and parents work together, using a range of tools created by the museumâ€™s prop shop to keep their feet out of the vivid flow below. â€Our shop built things that look like rocks  â€”   though safer than rocks  â€”   that you can jump from, as well as bean bags, wood planks, sand bags, rope,â€ says exhibit developer Michelle Blodgett. â€It was fun to see grandmas and grandpas having fun, helping their grandkids across the lava.â€ 4. Bubble Room  â€”   Boston Childrenâ€™s Museum. A classic exhibit thatâ€™s been around since 1985, the Bubble Room has several tables with different tools and ways of making bubbles  â€”   wands, straws, even a frame on a pulley system for pulling up a giant bubble sheet. The tiniest tots don smocks and can while away an hour chasing, holding and bracing themselves for the inevitable pop! Simple? Sure. But, â€itâ€™s evolved through years of protoyping,â€ says Alexander Goldowsky, the museumâ€™s senior vice president of exhibits and programs. In fact, the plans for the bubble exhibit have been sold and copied at museums all over the world. â€A lot of our best exhibits take a phenomenon thatâ€™s intrinsically interesting and present it in a way that leads to as many different investigations as possible,â€Goldowsky says. â€Thereâ€™s no single answer where you can say, â€™Ok, now Iâ€™ve got bubbles.â€™ You can always take it to another level.â€ 5. MAKESHOP  â€”   Childrenâ€™s Museum of Pittsburgh. In one corner of this sunny,   interactive space, kids are goofing around in front of a green screen the iPad display shows their heads floating in a distant galaxy. Others are learning how to operate a floor loom or sew their first stitches. And in the middle, at a big table, a group of 10 are messing around with â€circuit blocksâ€  â€”   connecting alligator clips to batteries to light a light, turn on a fan or make a salvaged CD tray shoot open and closed. Walls are hung and shelves are lined with previous projects like a cardboard â€flea circusâ€ and scarves woven from   tape. MAKESHOP is a mashup of   and high, where kids delight in seeing their ideas take form, sometimes in partnership with visiting artists who have specialties like fiber arts and sculpture. â€We try not to influence decisions too much,â€ says Molly Dickerson, the museumâ€™s learning resource coordinator. â€We want familiar materials that are not so polished so kids feel free to take it apart and put it together.â€ For many visitors, this is their first encounter with sandpaper, a screwdriver or a sewing machine, and maybe the beginning of a lifelong love of making. 6. S. E. C. R. E. T"
171091,893,secondary,3,"â€”   Childrenâ€™s Museum Of Houston. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to defeat the evil Arcturus Vex and R. I. V. A. L. (the Ridiculously Intelligent Villainous Agent League). Vex is after a cluster of mysterious crystals that were discovered beneath the museum during its 2009 expansion. Defeating Vex requires visitors to successfully complete six different missions, each taking between 60 and 90 minutes. Kids get a mission book with a map, clues and some vital gear, including a USB drive, spotting scope and lenses to read secret codes. The exhibit requires both physical exertion and some serious   says Keith Ostfeld, the museumâ€™s director of educational technology and exhibit development. Oh, and how could we forget this: â€You have to get through a laser maze  â€”   R. I. V. A. L. â€™s base of operations inside the museum,â€ Ostfeld explains. â€To get in, you have to hack their security code. And, once youâ€™re in, if you run into too many lasers, the whole thing will shut down, forcing you to start over.â€ 7. Treasures of the Earth  â€”   Childrenâ€™s Museum of Indianapolis. This fantastically detailed archaeology exhibit gives families the opportunity to travel the world without leaving Middle America. Theyâ€™ve   a tomb from Egyptâ€™s Valley of the Kings, the Caribbean shipwreck of Captain Kidd, and the burial site of Chinaâ€™s Terracotta Warriors. One feature that sets the Childrenâ€™s Museum of Indianapolis apart is a   cast of costumed interpreters. Local actors dressed like Indiana Jones are on hand to draw kids into the adventure of decoding cartouches or deciphering pirate maps. But, this isnâ€™t Disney World. The exhibit includes real artifacts that are designed to get parents asking questions and talking with their kids. â€Families who engage better stay longer,â€ have more fun and learn more, says Jennifer Pace Robinson, the museumâ€™s vice president of experience development and family learning. â€In the 25 years Iâ€™ve been in the field, we have adjusted how we measure success. Instead of focusing on content acquisition, research shows that starting conversations is more likely to help kids make connections and apply it to future knowledge.â€ 8. Shop Rite Supermarket  â€”   Please Touch Museum, Philadelphia. For kids who are too young to take on Arcturus Vex or scale the Hodge Podge Mahal, Phillyâ€™s Please Touch Museum offers this faithful  â€”   albeit    â€”   reproduction of that most magical of places: the grocery store. Stacey Swigart, PTMâ€™s curator of collections, says itâ€™s easily one of their most popular exhibits. Why? One word: detail. Kids can grab their own shopping cart, bag or basket and choose from hundreds of faux groceries, from bananas and   breads to toaster pastries and that Philly classic, Tastykakes. Theyâ€™ve even added flowers and magazines for   stuck waiting in the   lines. Swigart admits, the supermarket can be a heavy lift for staff  â€”   not just   the shelves night after night but also giving the hundreds of faux foods a regular deep cleaning. Still, she says, itâ€™s worth it. â€Kids love the real experience,â€ Swigart says. â€They want to be like their parents. They want to be in charge and decide if theyâ€™re going to have celery or pineapple for dinner.â€ 9. Colored Shadows  â€”   The Exploratorium, San Francisco. Picking just one exhibit in this   science center is â€like picking between your children!â€ protests Julie Yu, the director of the museumâ€™s Teacher Institute. But this simple exhibit, which uses different colored light sources to allow people to explore casting shadows in different hues, is a longtime   favorite. â€Right now, in our new space, itâ€™s along a corridor, and itâ€™s pretty rare that people just walk by it,â€ Yu says. Her goal as a designer is to pull in what they call the â€ â€ from the sidelines and pique everyoneâ€™s curiosity through the use of â€treatsâ€  â€”   like the opportunity to turn certain lights on and off. Colored Shadows is as likely to inspire a     dance party as a serious investigation of the physics of light. 10. Reading Adventureland  â€”   The Strong National Museum of Play, Rochester, N. Y. Any kid or former kid whoâ€™s ever stayed up late reading with a flashlight under the covers is going to be captivated by Reading Adventureland. Designed to make you feel like entering a giant   book, visitors can scale a beanstalk and play a giantâ€™s game of chess cross a bridge (beware of trolls!) dress up and pretend to bake cookies in a gingerbread house make a wand in the Wizardâ€™s Workshop admire a pair of Dorothyâ€™s ruby slippers brave the dark in Mystery Mansion, or stumble down the crooked, crooked halls of Nonsense House. The exhibit is all about â€imaginative play,â€ says Debbie McCoy, The Strongâ€™s assistant vice president for education. Best of all, the Museum of Play is also a branch of the cityâ€™s library, so each section has books to curl up and read or even take home. When youâ€™re done reading your favorite story? Act it out on the storybook stage, or go to the storyboarding workshop and sketch out a sequel."
217760,894,primary,237,"  MOSUL, Iraq  â€”   Hundreds of thousands of people who remain in this northern Iraqi city are struggling to find food and safe drinking water as the protracted offensive against Islamic State militants batters their neighborhoods"
217760,895,primary,58,"When the battle began seven weeks ago, aid agencies feared that an exodus from the city would overwhelm already crowded camps. Instead, most people heeded government advice to stay in their homes as security forces advanced. Now many of those residents lack even basic services, with water supplies cut by the fighting, and U. N. and government aid distributions unable to reach all of those in need. Some residents are moving from neighborhood to neighborhood in search of food or to escape the bombardment. Meanwhile, in areas still controlled by the Islamic State, a siege by security forces is slowly tightening, pushing up food prices and causing shortages while the militants prevent people from leaving. Iraq is struggling to meet the needs of 3. 2 million people displaced over the past three years during fighting against the Islamic State. To limit the displacement from Mosul, the government airdropped leaflets over the city telling civilians to stay put"
217760,896,secondary,47,"    (Video: Reuters   Photo: AP)   But few commanders expect the battle to finish anytime soon, and the misery unfolding in Mosul is expected to worsen as winter sets in. Reaching people inside the city is risky for humanitarian agencies, which also say they do not have enough aid to meet the need. This month, Iraqi counterterrorism forces escorted a truck carrying bottled water into the neighborhood of Zuhoor, which had been retaken two days earlier. People quickly crowded around to grab whatever they could. â€œIs there any food?â€ they clamored. â€œWe donâ€™t have any food. â€  Because of the shortages, some residents have decided to leave the recently reclaimed neighborhoods and move to others on the cityâ€™s edge that are better supplied. Only people who end up in the camps are included among the official number of displaced  â€”   100, 000 people  â€”   and the United Nations says it has no way to gauge how many internally displaced are in the city. Jassim   Iraqâ€™s deputy minister for migration and displacement, estimated that more than 150, 000 are displaced within the city and that hundreds of thousands of others remain in their homes but still need aid. â€œThere is some aid, but itâ€™s a big battle,â€ he said. On the far eastern outskirts of the city, Haitham Mazin, 40, his wife and three children are living with a relative in Gogjali, where water and food are distributed more frequently, and some medical assistance is available. Mazin had wanted his family to stay in their home in the Zahra neighborhood after the area was retaken by Iraqi security forces, but the food and fuel he had stockpiled ran out. He said that aid distributions were haphazard and that while some people with connections to security forces had received enough assistance to even sell some, other families, including his, had gone without. Dependent on well water, which is not safe to drink, residents had fought when water supplies arrived, he said. â€œWe became like beggars,â€ he said. â€œThe government at the beginning told us to stay home, but they didnâ€™t provide anything for us. â€ Half the direct assistance provided by the United Nations since the beginning of the operation for Mosul has been distributed to those in the city, said Lise Grande, the organizationâ€™s humanitarian coordinator for Iraq. â€œWe are very worried that we are going to run out of supplies,â€ she said. â€œWe only have limited amounts of stocks, and if everyone near and inside Mosul requires help, we wonâ€™t have enough  â€”   not by a long shot. â€  The United Nations and its partners are providing food parcels to sustain families for a month  â€”   after which the governmentâ€™s   system is supposed to take over. â€œWeâ€™re hoping this happens, because in many locations the first month is nearly over,â€ she said. Younes Sabri, 30, left the recaptured neighborhood of Bakr this month with his mother and two children. There was no food, water or electricity, he said, and the mortar shells were still falling. At first he had walked an hour each day to Gogjali in search of supplies to take back to his family, but then he had decided to move into the house of a friend in the neighborhood who had left for a camp when the area was engulfed in fighting. â€œThe humanitarian situation there was very bad. Even the basics were not available,â€ he said of his neighborhood. But like others, he is wary of the camps, because once people are there, they are not allowed to leave, not even if their neighborhood has been retaken. â€œPeople of Mosul have only two options,â€ he said. â€œEither stay inside and die because of the bombing or hunger, or go to the camps  â€”   to the prison. Either way, itâ€™s a slow death. â€ Attiyah, the government minister, cited â€œsecurity reasonsâ€ for restricting the movement of those in the camps. The governmentâ€™s decision to try to keep people in their homes has slowed the battle, limiting the use of heavy artillery and airstrikes. Commanders are urging Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   to allow them to move families out of their neighborhoods temporarily to quicken the battle, but that could add to the humanitarian burden. For the moment, people are being given the choice of whether to stay or leave. Attiyah said he expects the situation to worsen. Security forces have retaken neighborhoods on the eastern side of the Tigris River, which carves the city in half, but have not yet entered areas on the other side. The situation in those Islamic   areas is also a â€œtragedy,â€ Attiyah said. â€œThere is no water, no electricity, and a lot of the doctors have left. â€ Instead of heading to the camps, some people have fled to western Mosul. When the fighting starts there, he said, they will have nowhere to run"

202472,902,primary,135,"   Topology is a branch of math that studies what properties are preserved when objects are stretched, twisted, or deformed. Hansson, apparently anticipating our total ignorance of topology, helpfully brought along a cinnamon bun, a bagel, and a pretzel to explain it at the prize announcement. You can describe the number of holes in each shape topologically, he said. A bun has zero holes, a bagel has one, and a pretzel has two. There are no half holes. And the number of holes in these objects stays the same if you stretch or twist them"

Beyond theory, the research has also led scientists to develop new materials with novel properties, said Nils MÃ¥rtensson, acting chair on the Nobel committee on physics. Some of these materials are called â€œtopological insulators,â€ which conduct electricity solely on their surface"
202472,905,tertiary,16,"           These topological insulators havenâ€™t made it into any commercial products yet, but the Nobel committee and the scientists are still excited about the possibilities for using them in quantum computing and other    discovered applications. One of these insulators, called stanene  â€”   basically a   thick layer of tin  â€”   will conduct electricity at high temperatures with little resistance. One day, scientists hope stanene could perhaps replace copper components in computers"

This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity"

CF: Was there anything you knew you definitely didnâ€™t or did want to do going into this season? DW: There were so many stories in the past three seasons that I kind of felt were forced in because we needed a third story for a   episode. So I didnâ€™t want that to happen at all this season. The purpose and goal [of Drunk History] is that every story is in because itâ€™s an amazing story, and weâ€™ll figure out a way to tie it in"
202351,918,secondary,213,"   CF: Did the themes come first, or did you figure out the themes as the stories came up? DW: This season, the stories came first and then we figured it out. â€œOh, those were all escape stories, letâ€™s do one called â€˜Escapes.â€™ Those people were all legends, letâ€™s do one called â€˜Legends. â€™â€  It was fun, and if we do it again, Iâ€™d definitely go with themes first and then find the stories, because, uh, this was pretty hard.

DW: Sometimes I know theyâ€™ve always loved a story or a certain historical figure that I have researchers look into. Sometimes I just pitch them types of stories. Most of the narrators I know pretty well, so I know the types of stories they like, and then I present them with three or four stories that weâ€™re definitely going to do this season and let them pick which one of those that they really attach to"

I love that. Thatâ€™s the goal. Narrators have to be people who are passionate about the story and are dying for more people to hear it"
202351,921,primary,58,"  CF: So what makes someone a particularly good storyteller, outside of passion?

I know   Miranda was really excited about it. DW: It was really a gift. I had heard that he wanted to do it and was a fan.

I guess I just tried to treat it similarly to the other stories, humanizing these people and conveying why we need to know about this story, what was important about it, what we can learn from it. I just let it happen. My goal all the time is to make people feel as comfortable as possible. We shot it at his parentsâ€™ house, so, you know, thereâ€™s nothing more comfortable than getting drunk at your parentsâ€™ house while theyâ€™re upstairs listening to you drunkenly yell about Hamilton. CF: Did you know already that Aubrey Plaza and Alia Shawkat were going to play Hamilton and Burr? How did that casting come about? DW: That took a little time, because we wanted to do something as an homage to the musical but not doing it exactly, with mixed races for everybody.

153198,956,secondary,558,"What is baseball without superstition? Rally caps,   that dare not speak their name until the seventh, and, of course, the dreaded postseason curse. For decades, the unholy trinity of baseball curses was the Cubs, Red Sox, and Indians. If you needed a shorthand for comic futility, you couldnâ€™t go wrong with of those three hapless franchises. Thereâ€™s a reason why Henry Rowengartner played for the Cubs after breaking his arm and magically developing an unhittable fastball in the movie Rookie of the Year why the Cleveland Indians threatened to move to Miami in Major League. The lovable loser story is great for sportswriters and filmmakers, but terrible for fans. But the payoff is unparalleled. Just ask the 2004 Red Sox. In a couple weeks, ask the Indians or the Cubs. Just donâ€™t ask the Dodgers. With the baseball gods about to give one of their two remaining Jobs a winter off from their perpetual misery, Iâ€™m starting to wonder where all of the   energy is going to go, and more and more, Iâ€™m seeing it fall directly into my lap here in southern California. I would much rather dispense with the entire notion of the sports curse, but thatâ€™s like asking the sun to be a bit less hot all the time, or suggesting Donald Trump keep his little tiny hands to himself. Thereâ€™s just no point. Somewhere deep down, sports fans (and especially baseball fans) need to be tortured. Itâ€™s why we bite our nails during tense playoff games, or, in my case, watch an entire two innings of game 5 of the NLDS via the reflection of the TV in the glass table at a bar because the Nationals hadnâ€™t scored a run since I started doing it. Laugh all you want, but it worked. Such is the life of a Dodger fan in 2016. Another year, another playoff disappointment. Yes, Iâ€™m throwing dirt on their grave prematurely, but thatâ€™s where my headâ€™s at. Thereâ€™s a culture of losing developing slowly here in Los Angeles. You can see it in the pained expressions of Dodger fans filing out of the stadium during the thorough drubbings of games 4 and 5 of the NLCS, the slow realization that, no, this is not our year. Again. To coin a phrase, itâ€™s   this run of playoff defeats. Whether itâ€™s a stout, efficient, humorless Cardinals team, the plucky Mets, the   Phillies or this blessed Cubs bunch, someoneâ€™s going to come to town ready to rip your heart out and give you a better reason to leave in the seventh inning than traffic. Never have I seen a playoff crowd quite like game 4 at Dodger Stadium. LA walked into that game up   up on a Cubs team that looked unstoppable just a week ago. Even LA Times columnist and ESPN commentator Bill Plaschke had the gall to declare in no uncertain terms that â€œitâ€™s overâ€ on Around the Horn the day after game 3, as though he actively wanted to see the Dodgers lose and was using some kind of reverse psychology to ensure his preferred result. That sort of   rhetoric certainly didnâ€™t extend to the tense crowd at Chavez Ravine on Wednesday. The vibe was nervy and joyless, one of expected defeat rather than impending victory. The rally towels they gave us walking into the park were used less to intimidate the opposing team and more to wipe the blood off of our faces after a succession of haymakers connected with our collective jaw. But this has happened before, and it will happen again. This year marks the fourth playoff run in a row for the Dodgers. Four NL West Division championships. Four thudding playoff exits. Yes, itâ€™s not over yet. The Cubs have to win one more game. They have to face the mighty Clayton Kershaw and stalwart junkballer Rich Hill. Worse yet, they have to win at home, at Wrigley Field, a stadium that should come with a trigger warning. Still, I know how this ends. These Los Angeles Dodgers have done a truly remarkable job piecing together a losing tradition to rival the   Brooklyn Dodgers  â€”   a team that was   to fall on their sword for the New York Yankees, as though they were programmed to do so like one of the robots from Westworld. Itâ€™s been 28 years since the last Dodger World Series victory, which doesnâ€™t seem all that long ago compared to the runs put together by the Cubs, Red Sox, and Indians. The Dodgers have won six championships, placing sixth on the list of most World Series victories. That makes them, at first glance, a dubious choice to assume the mantle of baseballâ€™s perennial groomsman, but what other team has been so close so many times in the last 20 years? Playoff disappointments in 1995, 1996, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Mike Piazza, Mannywood, and the McCourt family have all come and gone since 1988. Teams like the Brewers have significantly fewer playoff runs than that, but curse narratives are not about just being bad. Theyâ€™re about being bad when it really, really counts close, but not close enough. Only the Oakland Aâ€™s could claim to be more snakebitten in the postseason. The underground hallways of Dodger Stadium are lined with trophies, plaques, and framed jerseys of Hall of Fame players. Thereâ€™s an idea of swagger, superiority, and historical significance buried within the psyche of Dodger Nation, though it gets buried deeper after every October meltdown. This is an old, proud franchise, but one that has been eclipsed by, of all teams, the hated San Francisco Giants. Giants fans laugh at division title celebrations and scoff when Kershaw is called the greatest pitcher of his generation when heâ€™s never pitched a single inning in the World Series. Yes, Iâ€™m putting my Dodger gear back in the closet early, but only because Iâ€™ve seen this before. The last time the Dodgers were down   going on the road for game 6 of the NLCS, they got creamed by the St Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. Who was the starting pitcher for that decisive game? Clayton Kershaw"

167013,958,secondary,104,"If youâ€™ve been following the news about the spread of the Zika virus throughout Latin America, youâ€™ve probably gotten lost in the jargon once or twice. Whatâ€™s a vector? A reservoir? Whatâ€™s local transmission  â€”   the opposite of express transmission? So we went to the experts to help us wade through all this murky language. And they were helpful  â€”   sort of. Because it turns out that even the experts donâ€™t agree 100 percent on the definitions. â€Well the first thing to keep in mind with this sort of terminology is itâ€™s all in the eye of the beholder, to a certain extent,â€ says Dr. Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Technically, an outbreak and an epidemic mean the same thing, Monto says. Both refer to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease. Generally an outbreak is used to describe the spread of a disease in a smaller geographic area, whereas an epidemic may describe the spead of disease through several communities or cities. But the key difference is that the word â€outbreakâ€ sounds relatively innocuous whereas â€epidemicâ€ carries a bit more weight, Monto notes. â€So choosing which word to use is not pure science,â€ he says. Public health officials may choose to use one or the other depending on the sort of message they want to put out. â€With Zika, I think calling it an epidemic is a way to bring attention to it and mobilize resources,â€ he says. Since Zika has spread to South and Central American countries where it has never been identified before, and since scientists suspect a link between the virus and neurological problems in newborns and adults, Monto understands why health officials are using the more weighty â€epidemicâ€ while discussing Zika. The words endemic and pandemic have more precise definitions. The former is used to describe â€the baseline . .. level of the disease,â€ according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So thereâ€™d be an endemic level  â€”   or expected number  â€”   of flu cases in the U. S. each year. The latter refers to multiple outbreaks happening across the globe at the same time. â€Pandemic has been used to describe outbreaks of cholera occurring in various countries,â€ Monto says. In the 1960s, for example, an outbreak of cholera in Indonesia quickly spread across Asia, Europe, Africa  â€”   by the early 1990s, it had made its way to Latin America. A pandemic affects communities all over the world, Monto says. Itâ€™s a public health issue of international concern. Now letâ€™s turn to another set of words used to describe the mechanics of an outbreak like Zika. Like, what the heck is a disease reservoir if not a terribly disgusting lake? â€Itâ€™s any environment where an infectious agent can live and multiply,â€ says Allison Aiello, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It could be one or more insects, animals, even soil  â€”   â€anywhere these   viruses or microbes can live and thrive.â€ But typically, the word refers to animals who can carry a disease,â€ Monto says. Say that Zika can make both monkeys and humans sick  â€”   monkeys infected with Zika would be considered the reservoir. â€We donâ€™t generally use the term reservoir for humans,â€ Monto notes. Thatâ€™s because â€even if we eradicate the disease among humans, weâ€™d want to pay attention to the animal reservoirs to make sure a monkey doesnâ€™t reintroduce the disease and cause it to come back.â€ Then thereâ€™s the term vector. â€A vector is anything that can pass on an infection to another organism,â€ says Aiello. So a mosquito is definitely a vector. Its root is a Latin word that means â€to carry.â€ But what about humans: Can we humans be vectors? Technically, sure, says Aiello. But Monto says he probably wouldnâ€™t use the word to refer to humans. â€To me vector is usually an arthropod [insects and other animals with exoskeletons],â€ Monto says. â€Like a mosquito or a tick.â€ So the Aedes aegypti mosquito, whose bite transmits Zika, is a vector for the disease. When public health folk talk about â€vector controlâ€ theyâ€™re usually thinking about calling in the entomologists or deploying health workers to fumigate the swampy,   neighborhoods. â€So you see, we use specific words to mobilize specific sectors within the public health community.â€ Ultimately, itâ€™s a matter of preference. Got it. And whatâ€™s local transmission? Thatâ€™s when a vector transmits a virus to a human in a certain place. â€To have local transmission youâ€™ve got to have the vector and the virus present in the same place  â€”   thatâ€™s when the disease can really start to spread.â€ How do people in the public health world keep all this straight? â€Honestly, when talking to a general audience, I try to avoid using any of this kind of language,â€ Monta says. â€And when talking with colleagues in my field, we just focus on the facts and statistics!â€"

Russian state TVâ€™s flagship Vremya evening news show had another take: â€Terrorists and Western countriesâ€ were wrongly trying to blame Damascus. Vremya, which inherited its name from the Soviet Unionâ€™s main evening news show, cut to a spokesman for the Russian defense ministry who said what had actually happened was that Syrian air force jets had bombed a â€terroristâ€ bomb making factory that contained chemical weapons procured in Iraq, a version dismissed as impossible by Western countries"

Moscow shows no sign of turning on the Syrian leader, who, although not particularly well liked in some Moscow foreign policy circles, is seen in Moscow as an anchor of stability.

184941,967,secondary,52," President Barack Obama will take his case for new gun control measures directly to the American people this week while proposing new executive actions in a final big effort to reduce gun violence during his last year in office. Obama meets with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to discuss his administrationâ€™s options for tightening gun rules without going through the   Congress, which does not support the   legislative changes that the Democratic president prefers. Although the White House has not spelled out his plans specifically, they are expected to include measures that would require more gun sellers to become licensed dealers and conduct background checks on buyers. Guns are a potent issue in U. S. politics. The right to bear arms is protected by the U. S. Constitution, and the National Rifle Association, the top U. S. gun rights group, is feared and respected in Washington for its ability to mobilize gun owners. Congress has not approved major   legislation since the 1990s. Republicans have roundly criticized the presidentâ€™s plans, calling them an overreach of his executive authority. â€This president wants to act as if heâ€™s a king, as if heâ€™s a dictator,â€ New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican presidential candidate, said on â€œFox News Sunday. â€ â€This is going to be another illegal executive action, which Iâ€™m sure will be rejected by the courts.â€ Obama will take part in a   town      session on gun control broadcast on CNN at 8 p. m.

The event, moderated by anchor Anderson Cooper, will give Obama a chance to respond to criticism and raise public support for the measures before his State of the Union address on Jan. 12. Obama launched a push to tighten U. S. gun laws after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting massacre in 2012. But the push stalled in Congress.

The letter, signed by all the committeeâ€™s Democrats, alleges that the donation in 2013 â€œmay have influenced Mrs. Bondiâ€™s official decision not to participate in litigation against Mr. Trump,â€ and asks Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to explore whether federal bribery or other laws might have been violated. Separately, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on CNN Tuesday that his office was â€œconcerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some improprietyâ€ and had â€œbeen looking into the Trump Foundation to make sure itâ€™s complying with the laws that govern charities in New York. â€      Speaking to reporters aboard her plane Sept. 5, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said sheâ€™s â€taken abackâ€ by revelations about Donald Trumpâ€™s foundationâ€™s gift to a political group connected to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. (Video: The Washington  : Melina Mara)   Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said officials had received the letter from House Democrats and were reviewing it. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Republican presidential candidate, said: â€œThat is a totally ridiculous and false mischaracterization that blatantly disregards the facts. This is clearly a politically motivated attempt to distract from all of Hillary Clintonâ€™s issues. â€   [Trump camp says $25, 000 charity contribution to Florida AG was a mistake]   Of the New York Attorney Generalâ€™s announcement, Trump communications adviser Jason Miller said: â€œAttorney General Eric Schneiderman is a partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years and has endorsed Hillary Clinton for President. This is nothing more than another   hit job designed to distract from Crooked Hillary Clintonâ€™s disastrous week. â€ A Justice Department investigation would be separate from that run by the New York attorney general, though the state might have some parallels in its tax and other laws. A person familiar with the New York attorney generalâ€™s investigation said it would be broader than the donation to Bondi. The Washington Post recently has reported on a number of possible violations of IRS rules by the Trump Foundation  â€”   which appeared to have filed incorrect tax paperwork and twice to have spent charity money to buy items for Trump himself. IRS rules prohibit charity officials from spending their nonprofitâ€™s money to buy goods or services for their own use"
215189,972,primary,218,"    The Washington Postâ€™s David Fahrenthold breaks down the controversy over Donald Trumpâ€™s improper $25, 000 donation to a political group connected to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was at the time considering whether to open a fraud investigation against Trump University. (Sarah   Washington Post)   The person familiar with the New York attorney generalâ€™s investigation said that inquiry would also examine an incorrect tax return, filed by the Trump Foundation in 2013, which omitted the prohibited gift to Bondi and included a nonexistent gift in its place. The same person said the inquiry would also examine cases of apparent â€œ â€ that The Post reported in which Trump used foundation money to buy both a $12, 000 autographed football helmet and a $20, 000 portrait of himself. Aides to Trump have already conceded the donation to Bondi was a mistake stemming from clerical errors. Federal rules prohibit charities from donating to political candidates, and the Trump Foundation did not list the gift in its filings with the IRS in 2013. Trump paid the IRS a $2, 500 penalty this year, and representatives for the Trump Organization have said he reimbursed the charitable foundation from his personal account. All of that occurred after news reports and watchdog groups began raising questions. If the donation were meant to persuade Bondi not to involve her office in any investigations of Trump University  â€”   which is the target of several lawsuits by former customers who claim they were misled  â€”   that would potentially be more significant. Whitney Ray, a spokesman for the Florida Attorney Generalâ€™s Office, said there was no basis to investigate Trump University because, in 2013, the office had received only one consumer complaint, and â€œthe matter never rose to the Attorney Generalâ€™s level for any decision of any kind. â€ He said the only consideration that Bondiâ€™s office gave to initiating a Trump University investigation in 2013 was that a staff member â€œbriefly reviewedâ€ allegations of another case in New York to see if they had relevance to Florida. â€œThere was never any recommendation by the staff to investigate or sue Trump University in 2013,â€ Ray said"

Trump, who in the past has boasted about currying favor with politicians by donating, said of what he was trying to get: â€œIâ€™ve just known Pam Bondi for years. I have a lot of respect for her. Never spoke to her about that at all. And just have a lot of respect for her as a person. And she has done an amazing job as the attorney general of Florida. She is very popular. â€ The Justice Department has increasingly found itself at the center of the election this year. The department had been investigating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and even though the FBI and Justice Department concluded the probe should be closed without charges, Republicans have held several hearings and sent letters demanding more information. They also have pushed for new investigations of whether Clinton lied under oath to Congress and of how and why some emails that were under a preservation order came to be deleted.

As CIA director, Pompeo will be responsible for managing a global spying network at a time of escalating security problems, including renewed aggression from Russia, the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and the splintering terror threat posed by the Islamic State.

S. Military Academy at West Point. â€œIntelligence agencies are vital and very, very important,â€ Trump said at his news conference this month. He singled out Pompeo, saying that his administration was â€œputting in some outstanding people. â€ His comments signaled that his hostility toward the agency might subside when his designated director is in charge. But CIA veterans say that Pompeo may face more fundamental challenges, including whether he will be listened to at the White House and able to insert hard information into debates presided over by a president who has suggested he sees information on WikiLeaks as more reliable than the contents of intelligence briefs. Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA and a supporter of Hillary Clinton during the campaign, said that he has â€œcome to admireâ€ Pompeo after the two engaged in a series of conversations since Pompeo was tapped for the job. Morell said he expects Pompeo to arrive at the CIA without any preconceived notions, putting off any decisions until he has had a chance to survey its work. â€œPompeo has two key challenges: winning over a workforce a bit skeptical of him .â€‰.â€‰. and making the CIAâ€™s voice heard at the Trump White House,â€ Morell said. â€œI know Pompeo, and he will succeed at the first challenge. The second will be the defining issue of his tenure as director. â€  During his confirmation hearing, Pompeo vowed that he would defy Trump if ordered to direct the agency to resume brutal interrogation measures on terrorism suspects. He described the consensus view of U. S. spy agencies that Russia hacked the election in part to help Trump as a â€œsoundâ€ judgment.

Each weekend, we highlight some of the best stories. â€He was a New York story because he didnâ€™t have a lot and yet he gave a lot.â€ So begins the second paragraph of this wonderful story from N. R. Kleinfield in The New York Times. He weaves the tale of Bernhardt Wichmann III, a man who couldnâ€™t speak but whose kindness and jovial attitude spoke to so many in his Manhattan neighborhood. I found myself entranced by the arc of this story, eager to learn more while expecting the inevitable turn that the title gives away. Along the way, small anecdotes pepper the narrative  â€”   the Metropolitan Opera,   English lessons  â€”   with the kind of humanity we too often forget exists. Thereâ€™s a twist you wonâ€™t expect and a crushing final line that wraps up a story that does what few can do: it will leave you smiling through tears. Thereâ€™s good, healthy cuisine in Pittsburgh, I swear  â€”   we just also have food with greasy French fries where they normally shouldnâ€™t belong. (Get you a city that can do both.) So I was surprised to see Eaterâ€™s lengthy tribute to the underappreciated Pittsburgh Salad, which requires â€a layered bowl of cool lettuce, some veggies, grilled chicken (or steak) and a sprinkling of shredded cheese, all served with French fries.â€ Maybe it contradicts the very idea of salad, or maybe it improves it. The salad is like the famous Primanti Bros. sandwich  â€”   with fries and coleslaw stuffed inside  â€”   but with a sense of refinement, Shannon Reed writes. Now, Iâ€™m no fan of either dish myself (although I will always rep for Pamelaâ€™s Diner, which Reed says makes the best version). But this piece also serves as a loving tribute to the city that, until the last few years, has also gone underappreciated: â€The Pittsburgh salad is the perfect Pittsburghian compromise: mostly sensible, but a little indulgent modern, but of the past the stuff of lunch hours and   dinners, but also worth looking forward to after a long morning of   or as a   reward on a Friday night out with friends.â€ When reporter Rukmini Callimachi writes a story, you brace yourself.

Offline, meanwhile, she travels to areas at the margins of jihadist sites to speak with escapees and does her best to visit jihadi and ISIS strongholds after theyâ€™ve been liberated. Most arresting of all, if not entirely unexpected, is that nothing seems to scare Callimachi off. â€Iâ€™ve come to the point where I metabolize it pretty quickly,â€ she says. â€I love what I do, and I think my body understands at some level that I have to put some distance between myself and my work.â€ Is your Facebook feed hurting our democracy?
