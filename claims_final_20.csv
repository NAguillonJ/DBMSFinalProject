168266,0,primary,393,"Like so many Americans approaching retirement, Virginia Republican Rep. Scott Rigell dreams about spending a little more time on the water. ”I have a little rowboat called Miss Nelly. She’s 13 feet long, and there’s not a motor on it. There’s no radio on it. And I’m so looking forward to being on that rowboat,” says Rigell. Rigell is retiring after just six years in Congress. He was one of the 87 Republicans who rode the Tea Party wave to a pivotal GOP takeover of the House. At the end of this Congress, more than   of that class will be gone from the U. S. House. Like many of those freshman lawmakers, Rigell had never held any public office before he arrived in Washington. Before he took office, Rigell was a car salesman. He ran as an ”outsider” in a year when voters were tired of political insiders. As it turns out, some people who never harbored ambitions to be career politicians don’t love being politicians. ”I think, for many of us in my class, it truly wasn’t on the bucket list of life to be here. It wasn’t as if I was a junior in high school saying, ’I want to be a member of Congress,’ ” Rigell says"
168266,1,primary,87," members of his class have already left, although two of them now serve in the Senate: Cory Gardner of Colorado and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Three more House Republicans are running for the Senate this year. Another eight members of the class are retiring. The retiring lawmakers include a farmer, a decorated Army veteran and a construction company owner. ”I’ve had better jobs than this,” retiring Michigan Rep. Dan Benishek says with a chuckle. ”It’s amazing to me how people are like, ’Oh, I’ve got to run for Congress. That’s going to be the best.’ I don’t know. I never really felt that way.” Benishek was a surgeon before he came to Congress. He says voters frustrated at Washington should cheer these lawmakers’ decisions to retire after a few years. It’s like   term limits  —   and Benishek says that means fewer career politicians. ”There is a lot of turnover in Congress. Despite what people say about people staying forever, that’s not really the case. I think people didn’t realize how much turnover there is in general,” he says. Wisconsin Rep. Reid Ribble ran his family’s roofing company before he won in 2010. He’s retiring to spend more time with his family, but he conceded this: ”It would be disingenuous to say I’m not also frustrated with the work here.” Ribble and his retiring colleagues say they are, for the most part, proud of what a   House managed to get done these past six years. He cited making the Bush tax cuts permanent, new restraints on federal spending, and updated education and highway laws. ”These were fairly significant things that we got done while we were here, so some of us are saying, ’OK, we can go home,’ ” he says. Rigell agrees. He says he’s grateful for his time in Washington but, in a lengthy interview in his office, he keeps coming back to a nagging concern that the Tea Party class  —   and the years since  —   will also be remembered for another reason. ”Well, I’d say we were right at the cusp of when the American political system started to come unhinged. And it’s unfortunate,” he says. Rigell says he wants to continue work in his     life to inject more civility in American politics. There may be more job opportunities for that off Capitol Hill."
167939,2,secondary,454,"Lots of people are fuming about Nina, an upcoming biopic about legendary singer Nina Simone. According to its critics, the filmmakers butcher important parts of Simone’s biography (in part, by attributing much of her success to the men in her life) but that their larger sin was casting actress Zoe Saldana, who plays the lead role with the help of   makeup and a prosthetic nose. Many argue that casting the lighter skinned   actress, rather than someone who better resembled Simone, was an attempt to make the film more marketable instead of staying true to the singer and the life that inspired her art. The makeup and prosthetic nose, they also charge, were sloppy and poorly executed. In one of the more gentle critiques, singer India. Arie called the casting move ”tone deaf.” Others went with ”disrespectful,” ”deplorable,” and ”embarrassing.” Buzzfeed rounded up some of the Twitter reactions to the film’s trailer. Jezebel highlighted the overwhelmingly white team behind the production. Time magazine talked to Simone’s daughter, Lisa Simone Kelly, about the movie’s narrative flaws, and the Guardian chronicled some of the offensive backlash to people’s complaints about the film. Vox also voxsplained the whole controversy, from   to the release of the first trailer. But more than any other,   Coates’ recently published essay seems to capture the full emotional depth of all this frustration. He suggests this wasn’t just another questionable casting choice involving a person of color in a long line of such casting choices. To explain, Coates gets personal: ”When I was kid, I knew what the worst parts of me were —  my hair and my mouth. My hair was nappy. My lips were big. Nearly every kid around me knew something similar of themselves because nearly every one of us had some sort of physical defect —  dark skin, nappy hair, broad nose, full lips —  that opened us up to ridicule from one another. That each of these ”defects” were representative of all the Africa that ran through us was never lost on anyone. ”Africa” was an insult —  African   African   etc. Ethiopian famine jokes were all the rage back then. .. . ..[Nina] Simone was in possession of nearly every feature that we denigrated as children. And yet somehow she willed herself into a goddess.” Coates goes on to explain how Simone’s appearance, as well as her music, helped him view his childhood musings on race in a larger context: ”Simone is something more than a female Bob Marley. It is not simply the voice: It is the world that made that voice, all the hurt and pain of denigration, forged into something otherworldly. That voice, inevitably, calls us to look at Nina Simone’s face, and for a brief moment, understand that the hate we felt, that the mockery we dispensed, was unnatural, was the fruit of conjurations and the shadow of plunder. We look at Nina Simone’s face and the lie is exposed and we are shamed. We look at Nina Simone’s face and a terrible truth comes into view —  there was nothing wrong with her. But there is something deeply wrong with us.” Finally, Coates takes us through what all of this means, both for the potential audience and Nina’s creators: ”It’s here that the term ’appropriation’ bears some usage. We’re not talking about someone inspired by the deeper lessons of Simone’s life and her music. We are talking about people who think it’s fine to profit off her music while heedlessly contributing to the kind of pain that brought that music into being. To acknowledge that pain, to consider it in casting, would be inconvenient —  as   action always is. It would mean giving an opportunity to someone who’s actively experienced the kind of pain that plagued Simone. That would doubtlessly mean a diminished chance at garnering funds for such a film. And that, in turn, would court years of delays and the possibility of the film never coming into being. That would be unfortunate —  but less so for Nina Simone than for the agents who feel themselves entitled to profit her story.” The whole piece is worth reading and thinking about.

164667,3,primary,941,"Grocery stores in America have changed from neighborhood corner markets to   chains that sell convenience  —   along with thousands of products  —   to satisfy the demand of the country’s hungry consumers. What caused this transformation? And what will our grocery stores be like in the future?   food writer Michael Ruhlman, author of more than 20 books  —   including the   The Soul of the Chef and   of The French Laundry Cookbook with chef Thomas Keller  —   examines this phenomenon through the story of the Midwestern grocery chain Heinen’s. His new book, Grocery: The Buying and Selling of Food in America, not only offers insights on how we produce, distribute and buy food, but seeks ways of understanding our changing relationship with what we eat and how we get it. To talk about some of these issues, NPR’s Ari Shapiro of All Things Considered met with Ruhlman at a Harris Teeter grocery store in Washington, D. C. We’re going to dig into the store and wander around its various sections. But just standing here at the entrance, you can see a bit of produce, a bit of prepared food, a magazine rack, charcoal. Is there something you didn’t know before you started researching the book that you now see in a different way? The sheer quantity of stuff that we buy and that’s available to us. It represents the extraordinary luxury that Americans have at our fingertips, seven days a week. We are in the first section that most people usually walk into in a grocery store: produce. It was so interesting to read about the time that you spent with the produce buyers behind Heinen’s  —   the chain in Cleveland  —   and the debates they had about whether the cantaloupes were sweet enough, whether there were enough plums, whether anybody would buy the stone fruit after    in September . .. the things that we as customers never see. We don’t. We just expect it to be here: ”I want peapods for my   tonight. Where are they, I expect them to be here.” And [the store] wants you to have them. If you come there and they don’t have peapods, they’re going to lose a customer. The business is run at such a narrow margin that they really want to keep their customers, which is why you’re almost always asked at good grocery stores, ”Did you find everything you need?” Because that’s one reason why people don’t come back. Let’s work our way to the packaged stuff in the center. In a typical grocery store, how many different products are you going to find? There are about 40, 000. In the past couple of decades it’s gone up from about 7, 000. Food manufacturers have found that they can increase demand and sell more products if they give you more variety. For instance, barbecue sauces: Caribbean jerk, sesame ginger, Hawaiian, teriyaki . .. when’s it going to end? There’s got to be a limit as to how much we can actually absorb and choose from. I get the sense that you feel a little conflicted. On one hand, the grocery store is the embodiment of the greatest pinnacle of human achievement, and on the other hand, it’s row after row of depressing, processed,   junk. Yes. It’s the best of America and the worst of America right here in one bright   landscape. My father died shortly before I started [researching the book]. He loved grocery stores, and that’s part of why I [did this.] I think the grocery store is sort of a nostalgic place. We want to think the people who care about our food care about us. It goes back to that corner grocery store. But I don’t think they do anymore. So far, it doesn’t seem like grocery delivery has really taken off. Do you see that changing? I do believe more people will get their commodity groceries  —   the Cheerios, the cranberry juice, all the stuff in the middle of the grocery store they will get it delivered, because it’s all the same no matter where it comes from. The whole center of the store is going to go away or it’s going to be filled with specialty goods. That’s my hope. Grocery stores are going to shrink and become more specialty stores, and they’re going to sell better food. Is that, in some sense, a return to what it was like in the early days of the grocery store? That’s exactly what it’s returning to  —   when a small grocery would sell a variety of very special   goods. This interview has been edited for length and clarity."
156844,4,tertiary,436,"As Doug Andreassen, the chairman of US Soccer’s diversity task force, looks across the game he loves, all he can see is a system broken in America. And he wonders why nobody seems to care. He sees    families spending thousands of dollars a year on soccer clubs that propel their children to the sport’s highest levels, while thousands of gifted athletes in mostly African American and Latino neighborhoods get left behind. He worries about this inequity. Soccer is the world’s great democratic game, whose best stars have come from the world’s slums, ghettos and favelas. And yet in the US the path to the top is often determined by how many zeroes a parent can write in their checkbook. Andreassen watches his federation’s national teams play, and wishes they had more diversity. Like many, he can’t ignore the fact that last year’s Women’s World Cup winners were almost all white, or that several of the   players on the US Copa America roster grew up overseas. The talents of some of America’s best young players are being suffocated by a process that never lets them be seen. He sighs. “People don’t want to talk about it,” he says. Andreassen used to dance gingerly around the topic, using the same careful code words as the other coaches and heads of leagues, trying not to push or offend only to find that little changed. He has stopped being political. He is frustrated. He is passionate. He is blunt. “The system is not working for the underserved community,” he says. “It’s working for the white kids. ” But why? How come soccer can’t be more like basketball in America? How come athletes from the country’s huge urban areas aren’t embracing a sport that requires nothing but a ball to play? How have our national soccer teams not found a way to exploit what should be a huge pool of talent? “We used to say to ourselves: ‘How good would we be if we could just get the kids in the cities,’” one former US official says. And yet a quarter of a century into soccer’s American boom, that hasn’t happened. Coaches, organizers and advocates say interest is there, especially among immigrants from Mexico and Central and South America, where devotion to soccer runs generations in families. But finding those kids is hard. Money has only hardened the divide between rich and poor, leaving the game to thrive in wealthy communities, where the cost of organized soccer has become outrageous, pricing out those in lower income neighborhoods. “I don’t think it’s systematic racism,” says Nick Lusson, the director of NorCal Premier Soccer Foundation an organization to grow soccer in California’s underserved communities. “It’s just a system that has been built with blinders to equality. ” Three years ago, Roger Bennett of Men in Blazers and Greg Kaplan, a University of Chicago economics professor, set out to study the effects of the    system on American soccer. They compared the background of each US men’s national team member from 1993 to 2013 to that of every NBA all star and NFL pro bowler over the same period, using   data from their hometown zip codes. They found the soccer players came from communities that had higher incomes, education and employment rankings, and were whiter than the US average, while the basketball and football players came from places that ranked lower than average on those same indicators. Those numbers have tightened since 2008, reflecting more recent diversity in soccer, but the gap remains. “I’m  —   to be honest  —   surprised that the data is so striking,” Kaplan says. There are a lot of reasons for this disparity, but mostly everything comes down to perception and economics. “It continues to be seen as a white, suburban sport” says Briana Scurry, who won the Women’s World Cup in 1999 with the US, and was arguably the country’s most prominent black female player. As a child growing up in Minneapolis, Scurry loved basketball. She assumes it would have been the game she chose to play in college. That changed when her family moved to the suburbs when she was in grade school, and a teacher handed out flyers for a local soccer league. There had been no such activities in her former home. The idea city kids would play suburban soccer was too ludicrous to consider. People do want to change the    system. US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati says he believes the organization “has made a lot of strides” before adding: “We have a long ways to go. ” Andreassen believes Gulati is committed to the issue, as are a handful of others. But in a world where soccer coaches in wealthy communities can earn decent livings, there are few, like Lusson, who gave up what he calls a “cushy job” running a league in the pricey East Bay suburbs of San Francisco to direct a program in the underserved community of Hayward. “You are buying skill,” Scurry says of those parents who can spend on their children’s soccer. “But there are some pieces of the game that just can’t be bought. ” Sometimes on weekends Julio Borge, who is director of coaching at the mostly Latino Heritage Soccer Club in Pleasant Hill, California, will spend the day watching games in the ligas Latinas around San Francisco’s East Bay. Most of the area’s   population knows nothing about these games that are played at local parks in neighborhoods filled with immigrants from Central and South America. But to the families who gather on the fields to barbecue, listen to music and watch soccer, they are the highlight of the week. “The soccer is amazing quality,” says Borge, who will sometimes try to recruit players from the ligas Latinas for his teams. But with a cost of $1, 395 a year, which he uses to cover coaches, fields, insurance and officials, he knows most won’t afford to play on his team. He can occasionally offer a scholarship to a player if someone donates the money to do so, but there is never enough for the children whose families hover above the poverty level. “In my area, we are missing a ton of these kids,” he says. “A lot of coaches don’t have time to see everybody. It’s expensive to try out for the big programs, so many don’t even go after the opportunity. ” The cost of youth soccer these days is outrageous. Borge’s $1, 395 team is a bargain compared to many travel programs where the base fee is $3, 000 a year. “How can you charge that for just a year?” Scurry asks. “That’s ridiculous. ” And yet two of her friends are paying more than that for their kids in the Virginia suburbs of Washington DC. Across the Potomac River, in Maryland, parents can pay up to $12, 000 a year on soccer after adding the cost of travel to    tournaments. Most of these teams offer scholarships to kids with financial needs. The gift is kind and usually   but they come with their own problems. Usually they go to the very best players in the poor neighborhoods, and they come with the implication that the scholarship kid is expected to help their new team win. They also displace children in the lineup whose parents are paying full price, and wonder why they are spending thousands a year to have their child sit on the bench. Scholarships often cover the cost of the league but little else. They don’t provide transportation for the player whose parents might work during practice, or don’t have enough money for gas to drive to games. Some families don’t have email and can’t get the club announcements. Resentment builds. “The parents will say to scholarship kids  —   and I have seen this countless times  —   ‘Why did you miss the game on Saturday? We are paying for you to be here,’” Lusson says. “What does a kid say to that? Or what happens if they are late to practice? Or who is going to pay for them to travel to that tournament in San Diego? That’s like the moon to some of these kids. We have kids here in the East Bay who have never seen the beach. “They drop out of the program and then what happens?” he continues. “They have burned the bridge back to their old club by leaving, and aren’t welcome back. They drop out and drift away and we lose them and that’s terrible because they were really, really talented. ” Economics work against the poor kids in American soccer. Lusson sees this every week as he moves between the teenage girls team he coaches in the wealthy San Francisco enclave of Pacific Heights, and the teams he manages in   Hayward. One night, a few weeks ago, he listened as girls on the Pacific Heights team talked excitedly about applications to elite east coast colleges. The next day, in Hayward, nobody talked about college. And yet he is amazed by the skill of his Hayward players, who he says would crush the Pacific Heights team in a match. These are the players who could be the future of American soccer, perhaps even rising as high as a national team. But he also knows that the Pacific Heights players will be the ones to play on their college teams and will be identified by US Soccer. They are the ones who will get a chance that the Hayward kids won’t. And this strikes Lusson as very wrong. The other day, he went to watch a match between a team made up of mostly   San   college players against a group of players from poorer neighborhoods in the East Bay and Fresno three hours away. For a few minutes, the college players controlled the game until their untrained opponents deciphered their system, and then ripped it apart by  . In the second half, the East   team trampled the San Francisco team. “I’ve been seeing that game my whole playing career,” Lusson says. For a time, just out of college, he played professionally in Brazil. It feels rigid in the organized levels here, drained of any life. The difference is as simple as Brazilian children dribbling balls on the streets as they walk to school while American kids lug balls in bags, only pulling them out once they reach the field for a practice or game. “We are delivering a lot of people who do soccer but not play soccer,” he continues. “I think sometimes we have to be courageous with ourselves and admit when we have a problem. ” One of the biggest complaints about the    system is that the   in suburban programs strips kids of the creativity that comes from playing on the streets. Borge loves his recruiting trips to the underground leagues where kids are free from restrictions. Too often, when a skilled and imaginative player leaves their neighborhood team to join a bigger team in a wealthier community, their gifts are considered a hindrance. The clever dancing with the ball that makes them unique earns them the label of not being a team player. A message is delivered: conform or leave"
156844,5,secondary,473,"Those who deal in diversity in American soccer know this is a problem. They talk about it all the time. “We are making these little robots,” Lusson says. No one seems sure what to do. How do you tell players to be imaginative while at the same time fitting into the more rigid needs laid out by American coaches? No one knows. “I don’t know how to structure unstructured,” Gulati says with a chuckle. “I don’t know how else to say it. ” But coaches like Borge are looking for the answer to come from US Soccer. Borge’s voice rises as he begins to talk about the fractured network of leagues around the country, with coaches imposing their own unyielding vision of how soccer should be played. He wants someone in the federation to devise a strategy, not just for a style of play, but for getting the best players to the top. “We need someone to speak up  —   [Jürgen] Klinsmann or whatever  —   and say: ‘Here are the players we are looking for, and here’s how the system should be built,’” Borge says. “We have coaches who need to recruit talent from all over the nation and invest in the ODP and let them be creative and let the let them play freely. It takes huge dedication and it takes money but we have the money at US Soccer. ” “You want to know about diversity in soccer?” Andreassen asks. “Here’s a story about diversity in soccer. ” A few years ago, when Andreassen was head of Washington Youth Soccer, a    girl from a   community south of Seattle showed up in the town’s league. Her family was from Mexico, and she had grown up with several older brothers who loved soccer and had developed tremendous skill playing with them. The league organizers wanted her to go to an Olympic Development Program tournament in Arizona that is scouted by college coaches, and because her family had little money, a sponsor was found to pay for the trip. The girl played brilliantly at the tournament. She was surrounded by college coaches who flooded her with offers, which is unheard of for a sophomore in high school playing at an ODP tournament. But when she returned home her father banned her from playing soccer. He was undocumented, and he feared that if she became a college player, someone would notify the government and he would be deported. They never saw her again. The story stayed with Andreassen. It was yet another window into a gap that had been bothering him for years. How many cultural chasms between his white world and the invisible one  —   to him  —   around it existed? He wondered what would have happened if she had gotten hurt at the ODP tournament. One of his other great passions is the prevention of head trauma in soccer. What if she had gotten a concussion? Who would have taken care of her? Her family probably didn’t have health insurance. Who would handle the hospital bills? Things that are taken for granted in   and   neighborhoods don’t exist in the poor communities, opening the divide even more. When he took over as head of US Soccer’s diversity committee, he asked these questions on the quarterly conference calls he had with the other members. He pulled together lists of the things that didn’t work and tried to find solutions. “There are the kids in the diverse communities playing on the street corner, and we have to find them,” he says. “Someone knows they are there, either the church or the school. Maybe it’s a pastor or a principal or someone at the YMCA or Boy’s and Girl’s Club. We have to identify those community leaders. ” Andreassen really likes the Urban Soccer Leadership Academy, a program in San Antonio run by former mayor Ed Garza. Garza is using soccer in building teams similar to those in the suburbs  —   but at a minimal cost. Garza chose soccer as the foundation for his program because sports like football and basketball already had a strong infrastructure in San Antonio and there was no organization that held together the city’s immigrant families. He saw so much skill going to waste. “Our city teams were beating the suburban teams,” Garza says. “What if our inner city had a program to develop soccer players? Can you imagine how much better they would become, on a skill level, and get the attention of pro and college scouts?” The program, which is designed to help send as many kids to college as possible, has recently expanded from largely Latino neighborhoods to include African American communities as well. But what impresses Andreassen the most is it gives hope to the kids who would otherwise be lost in the    system the structure of a suburban team without losing their identity or style of play. He and his task force have written a proposal that has been delivered to US Soccer. He wants to create a national leadership academy to give leaders in underserved neighborhoods the power to build their own San Antonios. The academy would be based in a central location, with the hope to eventually build more around the country and it would exist to show those local principals and pastors and coaches how to make a league that operates like the suburban associations. They would be taught about fundraising and tax filings and field rental"
156844,6,tertiary,506,"But what they would get most is admission to the same world as the wealthy suburban clubs. Once underground leagues now would be on the map, in view of college coaches and federation and professional scouts. The kids playing on the street corner would have a greater possibility of being found. They would get a chance. Gulati has read Andreassen’s proposal but he sees a lot of proposals and a lot of ideas. The    model isn’t unique to the US, he says. It exists in more traditional soccer countries. What seems to discourage him is the extreme cost of the American system, as well as the fact that the federation has not been able to identify as many players in   neighborhoods as he would like. “It’s an important priority,” he says. “Look, we are in some ways still a developing foundation. ” In 10 or 15 years, Gulati hopes the US’s top teams will be more diverse, and that many of the walls that divide the rich and poor in soccer will have come down. He sees great promise in the growth of the MLS where teams like the Philadelphia Union are not only investing in youth development academies but building their own academy facilities as well. He is certain that the more soccer blossoms in the US, and the professional leagues establish themselves, kids who feel left out in today’s model will see a path for themselves in the game. Like everyone else, Gulati notices the racial makeup of the women’s national team, but he says the federation is working hard to build the game at the grassroots level. Someday he would love to see the sport grow to such a robust level in underserved neighborhoods that there will be a deep pool of talent that everyone knows about, and that some of those players will rise to the national team. “Everybody wants to do better,” Gulati says about diversity. There are signs of improvement. More coaches like Lusson are leaving wealthy suburban programs to help run teams in poorer areas. More programs like Garza’s in San Antonio are starting to grow. And funds are trickling into the neighborhoods that need them. The US Soccer Foundation (unrelated to the federation) has built several futsal courts in inner cities in an effort to recreate the free play of so many Central and South American children. It has also served 71, 000 mostly African American and Latino kids in its Soccer For Success program that provides coaching and mentoring for children in   neighborhoods. The program operates between the 3pm and 6pm, when school ends and parents are less likely to be home. “Everybody understands the issue,” says the foundation’s president and CEO Ed  . “Talk about a family living on $25, 000 with four kids in a place like Washington DC or even double that, $40, 000 in Washington DC. Those kids shouldn’t be barred [from soccer] because their parents don’t make much money. ” And yet how fast will change come? Yes, more than a third of the men’s roster in this month’s Copa América are  . But a good number of those learned their soccer overseas, because Klinsmann appears to feel the creativity is still lacking in American soccer. The women’s team going to the Rio Olympics, meanwhile, will almost certainly have a similar racial makeup as the one that played in last summer’s World Cup. “I don’t see why our team has fewer [black players] than England or France,” Scurry says. “The systems are different here and the people who have the access are the people who have the money. ” Families are still paying thousands of dollars for soccer teams that travel to faraway tournaments, which are often the only places college coaches go to watch players because their recruiting budgets are small. The poorest kids are still shut out. The game is not coming to them in flyers at school the way it did for Scurry in suburban Minneapolis so many years ago. Lusson says   parents driving their scholarship kids into wealthy neighborhoods are still getting pulled over by the police who wonder why they are there. Even MLS teams are motivated by money in opening their academies. Speaking privately, one executive says his team only takes players they believe they can monetize, either by developing for the team itself or selling that player to another club. This limits their reach because they rarely take chances on a borderline prospect, leaving a soup of expensive youth travel and elite soccer clubs to find and train that player. More than likely the system will not allow that to happen. “I’ve been doing this since 2002, and I don’t see anything that says this will change,” Borge says. On the phone, Andreassen, who can talk long and fast, is suddenly quiet. He is sure Gulati shares his passion, but he wonders if many others do. “I think I’ve pushed the ball one revolution,” he says. “But my goal is to get it down to the goalline. ” Sometimes he wonders if anyone notices. Is anybody listening? Does anybody care?"
152274,7,primary,707,"It was an ordinary,   flight from Oslo to Trondheim that I spent preparing for a speech I was to give upon landing. But when I turned my phone back on upon arrival, I noticed something very odd, something that had in fact never happened before. A post had been deleted from my Facebook page without any warning. I had shared one of the most iconic images from the Vietnam war  —   Nick Ut’s photograph of a naked, screaming child running away from napalm bombs, as a statement in the ongoing debate about Facebook’s editing policies. Facebook has taken a strong, rigid stance against “indecent” images. And it is commendable that they execute their role in the prevention of the distribution of images containing violence and child abuse seriously. We all have a responsibility towards this. Yet, by failing to distinguish between such images, and others that have formed the fabric of our history as a global society, Facebook neglects another important role that it plays on the world stage. To erase posts containing such images is to limit freedom of expression, democracy, the right to criticize and question, and view past events as they actually were, not as they have been deemed to be by one giant corporation. I am happy to note that Facebook has now decided to reverse that policy in this particular case  —   but serious questions remain"
152274,8,secondary,584,"Media consumption today is increasingly digitized, but even more so it is curated. News and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Flipboard have overtaken traditional news outlets as our primary sources of information, of news, of connection to the world around us. They have become our most frequently visited sites, especially among the younger generations, and have empowered the public to create and share their own content. With this ease of access to information in today’s world, comes a great responsibility to enact policies that make positive contributions to society. By exercising such overarching editorial rights, large corporations that ought to bring us closer together as human beings through transparency, end up altering history, and altering the truth. Already, Facebook and other media outlets’ algorithms narrow the range of content one sees based on past preferences and interests. This limits the kind of stories one sees, and in turn restricts access to a holistic outlook for the user. We run the risk of creating parallel societies in which some people are not aware of the real issues facing the world, and this is only exacerbated by such editorial oversight. As we move towards a more automated world, this is not a responsibility that should be surrendered to machines only. By deleting such iconic pictures that have played a crucial role in transforming world views on the pain and cruelty of war, Facebook is contributing to changing history. I want my children, and other children around the world, to grow up in a society where history is told as it was. In a society where they can grow into mature adults by learning from experiences of past generations, to be better informed citizens of the world. They need to understand what happened both in our darkest moments and our brightest. Today, images are the most powerful and important means of communication, and they must depict reality. It would be tragic for history, for the truth, to be told in the version that comes from any one corporation’s mouthpiece. This is why I believe it is imperative that such outlets take their responsibility seriously, while exercising such great influence over their users’ access to information. We have today shown that through the power of social media, we can influence social media. Let’s continue to do that. It is after all a platform for and made by the people, where you can’t let machines run your morality."
165221,9,secondary,81,"Renée Fleming and Francis Collins have something unexpected in common: music. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, plays guitar. Fleming, of course, is a renowned soprano. She is also an Artistic Advisor at Large to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D. C. and the two of them are joining forces this weekend for a program called Sound Health. The   event will explore connections between music, health, wellness and science through musical performances and presentations from neuroscientists. All Things Considered host Robert Siegel spoke with Fleming and Collins about their work together and what they hope to convey to the public about the intersection between art and science. They also sang a duet. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. On how their collaboration on music and the brain came about, Fleming: We met unexpectedly at quite an extraordinary dinner party. Collins: It was two years ago. It was on a Saturday night. It happened to be the Saturday night after the Supreme Court had issued their final decisions for 2015, and three of the Supreme Court justices were present. So, having a little unwinding going on there, because they had been on different sides. We had Anthony Kennedy, we had Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and we had Antonin Scalia, all gathering to have a wonderful dinner and a little music, which was provided by a sort of ok band  —   which, somehow, I think we took over. Fleming: We had an interesting conversation that night at dinner, because I said ”Do you think that we could collaborate with these two institutions? Put something together to amplify the work being done in this field?” and he didn’t hesitate. On research showing humans may have sung before they spoke, Collins: I think it’s increasingly becoming clear that must be the case. One of the really exciting findings that has recently come forward as we have better means of imaging the brain, [is] that if you put somebody in an MRI scanner and you look to see which part of the brain is getting activated when you hear a voice or when you hear a musical sound, they’re different. Your brain has a music room, and evolution would not have gone to the trouble of designing that if it didn’t have some benefits. So, that suggests to me that we and our ancestors have had music as a central part of our experience for eons. And we’re just beginning to understand how that might be. I think that’s fascinating. On whether Fleming thinks about her brain while she’s singing, Fleming: The brain has to support me in my singing, no question. Having to memorize in foreign languages that I don’t even speak is an arduous task. I participated in a study at the NIH. I was in an fMRI machine for two hours, singing this tune, [The Water is Wide] imagining it and speaking it. It’s not an attractive sound, especially because I’m competing with the sound of the machine, but it’s incredible to see the pictures  —   how it looks with the revolving brain and all the parts that are activated in this fMRI under those three different circumstances. It’s all quite different. On the opportunities presented by advances in brain imaging, Collins: For me it’s both a basic science opportunity, to use what we’re learning about how music affects the brain to understand the brain better, but it’s also got this therapeutic implication. Music therapy can be incredibly powerful for kids with autism, adults with Alzheimer’s and everything in between, but we don’t really understand most of the time how it works. We can give this field a stronger scientific base, and it can be even better. On future funding for research in the field of music and neuroscience, Collins: We’re just bold enough to think that we might be able to figure out how the circuits in the brain do what they do, and use that information to help people with many different disorders that affect the brain, including mental illness, including epilepsy, including traumatic brain injury. Music is part of that need for understanding. So, even though we’ve never been in a position where I would say we have enough resources, we would certainly want to prioritize this effort."
183159,10,primary,838," The U. N. Security Council on Friday expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the United States and Pyongyang’s only major ally China since President Donald Trump took office. The Trump administration has been pressing China aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor, warning that all options are on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development programs. The United States has struggled to slow those programs, which have become a security priority given Pyongyang’s vow to develop a   missile capable of hitting the U. S. mainland. ”The United States will continue to seek a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to this situation,” U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council after the vote. But she added: ”Beyond diplomatic and financial consequences, the United States remains prepared to counteract North Korean aggression through other means, if necessary.” Adding names to the U. N. blacklist   a global travel ban and asset freeze   was the minimum sanctions measures the Security Council could have taken and comes after five weeks of negotiations between Washington and Beijing. ”The Security Council is sending a clear message to North Korea today   stop firing ballistic missiles or face the consequences,” Haley said. The resolution, adopted unanimously by the   council, sanctions four entities, including the Koryo Bank and Strategic Rocket Force of the Korean People’s Army, and 14 people, including the head of Pyongyang’s overseas spying operations"

N. ban on ballistic missile launches. The U. N. Security Council first imposed sanctions on Pyongyang in 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear tests and two   missile launches. North Korea is threatening a sixth nuclear test. ”There is a critical window of opportunity for the nuclear issue of the peninsula to come back to the right track of seeking a settlement through dialogue and negotiations,” Chinese U. N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told the council. ”It is incumbent on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and to do more to help ease the tension and build mutual trust.” He again proposed a simultaneous freeze of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and South Korea and the United States’ joint military exercises. Russia said the suggestion merits ”serious consideration.” Haley said: ”We want a negotiated solution, but North Korea must fulfill its basic obligations by first stopping all ballistic missile launches and nuclear weapons testing and taking concrete steps toward getting rid of its nuclear weapons program.” U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Security Council on April 28 that it needed to act before North Korea does. Just hours after the meeting   chaired by Tillerson during his first visit to the United Nations as the top U. S. diplomat   Pyongyang launched yet another ballistic missile. ’UNFRIENDLY STEPS’ Within days the United States proposed to China that the Security Council strengthen sanctions on North Korea over its repeated missile launches. Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions before involving the other council members. Pyongyang has launched several more ballistic missiles since then, including a   missile on Monday that landed in the sea off its east coast. Diplomats said it appeared China was still only likely to consider additional strong new U. N. sanctions measures, such as an oil embargo, a ban on Pyongyang’s airline or tougher economic sanctions, if North Korea conducted a   missile launch or another nuclear test. The last round of complex sanctions imposed by the Security Council took three months to negotiate following Pyongyang’s fifth nuclear test in September. Those measures aimed to cut North Korea’s annual export revenue by a quarter. China has also been infuriated by the U. S. deployment of an advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)   system in South Korea, saying it was a threat to its security and would do nothing to ease tension with Pyongyang. Security Council veto power Russia backed the U. N. measures on Friday. Moscow’s support had been unclear after the United States imposed its own sanctions on Thursday on Russian firms for their support of North Korea’s weapons programs. ”This step is something that is very puzzling and deeply disappointing,” Deputy Russian U.

During the past couple of years, new breweries were being launched at the rate of three a day in the U. S. New District Brewing is one of them. It just popped up in a   building in an Arlington, Va"

He makes sure all his patrons know that he’s a ”local”  —   his grandmother lived just a couple of blocks from here. Local is a big deal in craft brewing. ”Folks, when they come to a brewery, they want to meet the brewers,” Katrivanos says. ”And they want to connect with what they’re drinking.” Another big thing is, of course, flavor. Regulars Don Ripper and his friend Chana Morrow, who show up about once a week, are here for a tasting this evening. ”Really good balance,” Ripper says as he sips a golden IPA called Folded Note. Morrow has a darker brew, called Origins Unknown. ”Nutty, malty,” she says, as she savors. A desire for beers that have more taste is, not surprisingly, a big part of what’s driving the demand for craft beer. Just ask New District regular James Miervaldis  —   he says he loves the variety here and ”how they experiment.” Does he ever drink Bud or Miller? ”Oh, God no  —   never, never, never.” So, fueled by the unquenchable thirst of its customers for the next great flavor note, the craft beer industry has exploded like a poorly fermented bottle of home brew. Now 1 in every 8 beers sold in the U. S. is craft beer, and more than 20 percent of the money consumers spend on beer goes to independent and small brewers. Flying Dog Brewery in Frederick, Md. was founded in the 1990s. But CEO Jim Caruso says there’s been an even bigger boom since 2008, with a growth rate that’s pushed the number of craft breweries to more than 4, 000. Meanwhile, Caruso says, beer titans like Budweiser, Miller and Coors have seen sales trend down. So the giant brewers have taken action"

These developments, Caruso says, are persuading some people to start brewing because it’s the next ”get rich quick” scheme. And that’s led to some newcomers ”putting out some bad beer,” he says. He worries that if consumers get a few bottles of beer that’s not good, they may get turned off the industry. ”It may be months or years before they come back and try it again,” he says. But say you’re confident in your brewing skills: Is there still time for you to get into the business? Probably, says Bart Watson, an economist for the Brewers Association. New brewery openings outnumber closings nearly 10 to 1, Watson says. And the industry, which adds around $55 billion a year to the U. S. economy, now helps support 424, 000 jobs. But some parts of the country have become pretty crowded  —   perhaps overcrowded  —   with new breweries, Watson says. San Diego County, Calif. has more than 110 breweries, and Portland, Ore. has 60, just in the city proper. ”Those places are really pushing the limit,” he says. The craft beer movement largely started in the West, Watson notes, and is now moving eastward. That’s partly because state regulation of alcohol was strongest in the East after Prohibition and has been loosened more slowly. So, Watson says, in the East and the Southeast, there’s lots more room for craft beer to grow. And Watson offers another statistic that should ease concerns about a brewery bubble forming: There are about 8, 000 wineries in the United States, and, he says, ”Americans drink a lot more beer than they drink wine.” So, he says, as long as many of them are small, and locally focused  —   ”like a local restaurant”  —   he thinks there are plenty of opportunities and market niches where small brewers can thrive. So go ahead, start your own brewery. Just expect to come up with an initial investment of around $500, 000, and don’t expect to get rich, says New District’s Katrivanos. He is hanging on to his engineering job at the Pentagon until his brewery can pay him a salary. ”If you’re getting into brewing specifically to make money, I’d advise against it,” he says. If that’s your goal, he says, ”You should go start a tech company.”"
211502,17,tertiary,211," As Deflategate wore on, the lawyers representing Tom Brady forgot to do something essential. They forgot to argue their client’s innocence. Instead Jeffrey Kessler and the NFL Players Association got so lost in pushing their interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and trying to trim the powers of Commissioner Roger Goodell that they failed to drive home the essential point: How can a player be suspended for “conduct detrimental” when there was no conduct to begin with?  To date, we are still looking for a single shred of credible evidence that any human hand deflated the footballs in that AFC championship game. Where is the conduct? Much less the conduct detrimental? Somehow this point was missed in the many briefs and oral arguments. Consequently, three judges of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit missed it, too, ruling   in favor of the NFL and reinstating Brady’s   suspension. Even chief judge Robert A. Katzmann, whose   dissent left Brady some faint hope, missed it. Katzmann believes Goodell indeed invented “his own brand of industrial justice,” and if the chief justice thinks so, then perhaps a full 2nd Circuit panel will too, should Brady seek a stay and appeal. If he does, this time around his lawyers should emphasize the only truly salient point of the entire case. As New York Law School professor Robert Blecker put it, “What happened to the deflate part of Deflategate?”   [U. S. Court of Appeals rules in favor of Goodell in Brady case]  Regardless of whether Brady appeals, he and every other NFL player should now be on notice that their personal interests don’t necessarily overlap with the NFLPA and its lawyers.

A” will determine the future of a major clothing manufacturing plant in California, one of the most expensive U. S. states in terms of labor costs. Keeping jobs in the United States has become a hot button political issue since the presidential election. Ford Motor Co on Tuesday reversed plans for a $1. 6 billion factory in Mexico and said it would add 700 jobs in Michigan after receiving criticism from   Donald Trump. See graphic here: ( ) Amazon and Forever 21, as well as   apparel maker Next Level Apparel and brand licensor Authentic Brands Group LLC, are in talks with American Apparel and its financial advisers about submitting offers ahead of a deadline on Friday, the people said. Any successful offer would have to top a $66 million stalking horse bid by Canadian apparel maker Gildan Activewear Inc, which American Apparel agreed to when it filed for bankruptcy in November. Gildan’s offer included an option to keep American Apparel’s manufacturing plants in southern California, which employ about 3, 500 workers, making American Apparel one of the biggest garment makers in the United States. But Gildan plans to preserve only some of the California production should its bid prevail, the sources said. Many of Gildan’s production facilities are in   countries. An outcome in the auction is expected next week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. American Apparel declined to comment. Amazon, Forever 21, Next Level Apparel and Authentic Brands did not respond to requests for comment. A Gildan spokesman said in an email on Wednesday that it is putting together all the necessary information from its due diligence to best position itself in the auction. Amazon’s acquisition of American Apparel would be a major push for the   company into branded fashion and apparel. The   company began to launch private label brands last year. Forever 21, founded by   Do Won Chang, is known for its low retail prices, helped by lower labor costs abroad.

Part of American Apparel’s name recognition also stemmed from Charney himself, who was outspoken on immigration and fair wage issues, but was plagued by sexual harassment claims, which he has denied. The company was also famous for its sexually charged advertising. A 2009   with Immigration and Customs Enforcement over the legal employment status of 1, 800 employees sent American Apparel on a downward trajectory, according to court documents from the company’s 2015 bankruptcy. American Apparel had to fire these employees, more than a quarter of its manufacturing workforce. The layoffs caused production delays and a 90 percent    drop in profits in 2009, according to the documents. Charney was ousted in 2014, and the company’s finances deteriorated further, plus it struggled with an unsustainable debt load.

Countries close to the opposition were also asked to urge them to lessen provocations, he said. ”Am I expecting a breakthrough? No, I’m not expecting a breakthrough,” de Mistura told a news conference. ”But I am expecting and determined for keeping a very   momentum,” he said. Hours later, the Syrian opposition called for    negotiations with the government delegation, saying it was hoping for a ”serious partner” while casting doubt on Damascus’ readiness. Spokesman Salem   speaking to reporters, said the opposition delegation did not want this round to be like the one a year ago that was fruitless. Referring to the delegation led by Syrian Ambassador to the U. N. in New York Bashar  ’afari, he said: ”We have experience with this regime. They’re not here to negotiate about a political transition, but they’re here to buy time and commit more crimes in Syria. There’s no trust in this regime.” De Mistura said he hoped neither side would seek to disrupt the talks by provoking the other and that momentum towards a political solution was necessary to thwart ”spoilers” bent on derailing peace efforts. The U. N. Security Council, which met at the U. N headquarters to discuss Syria, said the humanitarian situation ”will continue to deteriorate further in the absence of a political solution to the crisis.” Ukraine’s Volodymyr Yelchenko, the council’s current president, said the council ”expressed hope that the   talks in Geneva will produce tangible results” while moving towards ”a   and   political transition.” Asked if it had been discussed whether Assad would remain in power, Yelchenko said that was a subject for the Geneva talks.

He doesn’t drink!” While a string quartet played 80’s rock hits, Nackers admitted that it is a bit ironic that one of the hottest tickets in town WHCD night would be put on by a fake news site, celebrating a caricature. When asked if it meant that The Onion was itself becoming establishment, he said, ”Hell no. I think it’s great. I love it.” For personal finance guru Suze Orman, who held court at multiple parties through the night, the entire scene is good  —   a chance for Washington to be something approaching its truest, kindest self. ”I think people play their roles very well on television,” she said, in between snapping selfies with fans. ”I think when the TV comes off, everybody likes everybody,” commenting on the fact that at events like these you often see Republicans   with Democrats. ”And I think they’re all good people. .. When it comes down to it, they’re nothing but people trying to make a buck.” And for this crowd, part of making that buck is remaining famous, and being seen. Whether a Hollywood or D. C. celebrity, nights like WHCD might be a requirement for personal brand maintenance. And not just nights, but the days of   and   and   and reception. The entire   complex. Maybe it’s not a party for all these people. Maybe it’s just part of the job."
176276,35,tertiary,38," After months of Brexit uncertainty, the first faint outlines of a plan from Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday have given investors in Britain’s pound something to work with at last   although substantial risks remain of the currency falling again. May confirmed what most Westminster watchers had come to expect, that Britain will pull out of the European Union’s single market when it exits the bloc and not look for a compromise deal to retain some of its benefits. But, perhaps sensing that a Supreme Court decision would force her hand anyway, she said that parliament would get a vote on the Brexit deal and that firms would be given time to make the transition to the new arrangements. Traders said the almost 3 percent rise in sterling against the dollar that followed   its biggest daily gain since at least 1998   looked mainly like a squeeze on those who had already made money in six often chaotic months rather than conviction that its fall may be coming to an end. Stefan Hofrichter, chief economist for giant German asset manager Allianz, said that in principle sterling at Tuesday’s levels around $1. 23 was significantly undervalued. But he remained reluctant to recommend buying it. ”It depends on the valuation measure but (it is) probably in the area of 20 percent (undervalued) which you could say is an argument to go long. But there are still a lot of uncertainties around it,” he said"
176276,36,secondary,28,"”For the time being we still don’t know exactly what Brexit means.” DECLINING SHORTS Prior to Tuesday’s action, sterling had fallen 20 percent against the dollar and 14 percent against the euro since the Brexit vote last June. That decline has come in often violent stages. It gained almost 6 percent against the dollar from late October to early December but then fell all the way back in an unbroken succession of weekly declines. Investment bankers have grown more divided along the way. While many expect more weakness into the launch of Brexit talks in March, only 18 of the more than 50 economists and strategists polled by Reuters at the start of this month expected sterling to weaken to $1. 18 or less within the next six months. [FXPOLLS] The measures of positioning run by the U. S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission as well as the currency world’s big banking players all point to a large reduction in net bets against sterling from their peaks in   to late October. That could be read as an indication of improving sentiment. But it could also be seen as a sign that there is more space within the capital limits of big investors to bet heavily against the pound again. ”Despite the price move last week, clients have been slow to return to selling sterling,” said Richard Cochinos, head of European G10 FX Strategy at Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader. ”Three out of Citi’s four client types were net GBP buyers last week, with leveraged GBP net selling so small it’s hardly worth mentioning. . .. Ample room exists on the positioning & flow side to rebuild shorts.” As companies factor sterling’s fall into their prices, inflation bounced back to 1. 6 percent in December, and it is expected to accelerate in the months ahead. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney hinted on Monday that there may be limits to how much price growth the bank can accept without responding with relatively tighter monetary policy, which would support the pound. Chancellor Philip Hammond, speaking at the same time as May, warned that currency volatility may dampen investors appetite for funding Britain’s large public debt. ”Clients are taking their time building positions, there is no firm conviction at the moment. In the   they are reassessing the drivers of the trends now,” said Ned Rumpeltin, head of European FX strategy at TD Securities"

200185,38,primary,479," Is Donald Trump really going to be the Republican presidential nominee?    After his victories this week, this   outcome looks more likely than ever, and Republican elites are increasingly resigning themselves to it. But he hasn’t clinched it yet. Trump has built up such a lead in the delegate count at this point that he’s all but assured to finish with more delegates than any of his rivals. By our count, he has around 990 delegates, which places him very far ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich:         Indeed, both Cruz and Kasich have been mathematically eliminated from getting enough delegates to win on the convention’s first ballot, under the party’s current rules"
200185,39,secondary,111,"  So the main drama now is not over whether Trump will get the most delegates, it’s about whether he’ll win an outright majority of delegates  —   1, 237, the magic number he needs to clinch the GOP nomination on the first ballot"
200185,40,primary,121,"  Right now, Trump has about 990 delegates. So he’s 247 or so away from the magic number, with 581 delegates still uncommitted or at stake in future primaries. The upshot is that Trump needs to win just 43 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch his majority"
200185,41,primary,119,"  But even if he falls a bit short of that majority, he now seems clearly on track to get very close to it. And the closer he gets, the more difficult it will be for the party to justify denying him the nomination. California and Indiana are the most important remaining states to watch The delegates that are still up for grabs fall into two main groups. There are about 500 delegates in the 10 states that haven’t voted yet, and then there are about 80 delegates who are uncommitted and free to support whomever they choose. The next state to vote is Indiana on this coming Tuesday, May 3, with 57 delegates at stake. In my view, this is the second most important state remaining, because it’s    (partly statewide, partly by congressional district) and has still seemed like it could tip to either Trump or Cruz. Most media commentators and politicos are interpreting Indiana as a   for Cruz at this point  —   if he loses it, his campaign will be deemed entirely dead rather than just mostly dead"
200185,42,tertiary,411,"  Four more states then vote in the remaining weeks of May. Of them, Nebraska is expected to give all its delegates to Cruz, West Virginia is expected to go strongly for Trump (though it has odd delegate allocation rules that could depress his total somewhat) and the candidates will split Oregon and Washington’s delegates due to proportional allocation. All this leads up to the final day of GOP primary voting: June 7, when five states will vote"
200185,43,primary,123, New Jersey is a    state that Trump is expected to win easily
200185,44,primary,133,"South Dakota and Montana are also    states, and are expected to go to Cruz"
200185,45,secondary,1,New Mexico is another proportional state where the delegates will be split
200185,46,secondary,540,"But the day’s biggest prize, and the state that will likely determine whether Trump clinches his majority, is California. There are 172 delegates at stake there, and 159 of them will be allotted    on the congressional district level (three delegates in each of the state’s 53 districts)  —   which means that broad strength across the state will be necessary to pick up most of its delegates. If Trump doesn’t manage to hit his magic number by June 7, however, he’ll still have some time before the   convention. And in the interim, he’ll work to win over those uncommitted delegates to try to get him over the top. (They’re from various states and territories due to quirks in local rules, including North Dakota, Pennsylvania, American Samoa, and Guam.) Trump could also try to peel some unbound delegates who have endorsed Cruz away from him, perhaps arguing that the party should avert a divisive and damaging contested convention. According to a tally by PhD student Daniel Nichanian, Cruz has 24 of these delegates. (Trump has been endorsed by 30 or so unbound delegates that could in theory defect from him, too.) Convention shenanigans to block Trump are possible theoretically but a tough sell practically So, you may be wondering, is the Republican Party really stuck with Donald Trump as its nominee? Can they really do nothing to stop him?    In fact, the 2, 472 delegates who go to the convention have a great deal of power  —   so much so that they probably could prevent Trump’s nomination if they really, really wanted to. The problem is that this would badly flout the modern norm that a party’s voters determine the party’s presidential nominee, and would cause a tremendous backlash  —   a backlash for which the party doesn’t appear to have an appetite. First of all, if Trump doesn’t lock down that majority of delegates on the first ballot, then he doesn’t become the nominee just yet. Multiple rounds of balloting will ensue, and more and more delegates will become freed up to vote for whomever they want. But what would happen after that isn’t clear. Many have argued that since Trump has done a bad job of ensuring his supporters are installed as his delegates, party support would surely swing elsewhere as a second ballot. Yet polling shows that Republican voters think the candidate with the most delegates from primary voting should get the nomination. So it’s possible that the delegates would be hesitant to defy what they perceive to be the public will to nominate the candidate who came in second or someone who didn’t run at all"
200185,47,secondary,87,"          Second, even if Trump does get an apparent delegate majority before the convention, there are various ways the delegates could, theoretically, change that. Most of these would involve changing the convention’s rules to tip the balance against Trump, which the delegates are perfectly free to do should they so desire  —   they have a lot of power! Yet the delegates will know full well that the more they actually use these powers to sway the outcome, the greater the backlash they’ll provoke. If current trends continue, Trump will have won the most delegates in primaries, the most votes, the most states. If GOP delegates change the rules at the last minute to block his nomination, it will (accurately) appear that they were trying to ”steal” the election from Trump, and infuriate his many supporters"
200185,48,secondary,348,"  Recent evidence has pointed toward the party starting to resign itself to the inevitability of a Trump nomination, rather than gearing up for an intensely controversial effort to block him:   Single biggest thing Trump has going for him now is this attitude taking hold in the party: https:  "

182358,50,primary,490,"The legislation, which now goes to the state House of Representatives, was spurred by the case of an emergency room physician charged last month under federal law with performing genital mutilation on two    girls at a suburban Detroit medical clinic. Another doctor and his wife who ran the clinic also have been charged in that case, believed to mark the first U. S. criminal prosecution of its kind. The three defendants could face prison terms of up to five years if convicted. Genital mutilation of girls, typically involving removal of all or part of the clitoris, is banned by several international treaties but remains a common cultural or religious practice in some African countries, including Somalia, Sudan and Egypt. State Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Rick Jones, a sponsor of the legislation, cited recent expert testimony before his panel describing Michigan as a ”hotspot” for genital mutilation due to its large community of immigrants from countries where such surgery is still routinely performed. ”It’s been hidden. But now that we’re aware, we want to make a very strong statement to the world   never again in Michigan,” he said. Aside from carrying tougher penalties than federal statute, Michigan’s legislation would allow arrests and prosecution by local law enforcement"
182358,51,tertiary,282,"It also would close a federal loophole by outlawing transportation of girls under age 18 within state boundaries for purposes of undergoing genital surgery, Jones said. Parents or guardians who bring children to Michigan from abroad or are found to have taken them overseas for such procedures could likewise be charged. The federal law, enacted in 1996, targets practitioners of female genital mutilation as well as individuals who carry a child across state lines to undergo the procedure. The package of four   Michigan bills cleared the state Senate unanimously, and Jones said he expects swift House passage and enactment by the governor in a matter of weeks. Jones said female genital mutilation bans have been passed or were under consideration in several other states, including Minnesota and Texas, but he believed Michigan’s would be the toughest. The World Health Organization has estimated that more than 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone genital mutilation, which can cause lasting health problems"

202889,53,primary,768," It’s not your imagination, and you’re not seeing double: There really are two movies out this weekend with the word ”inferno” in the title"
202889,54,primary,641,"  One of them, Inferno, is the third film in the Da Vinci Code series, based on the novel by Dan Brown, directed by Ron Howard, and starring Tom Hanks. The other, Into the Inferno, is a documentary that’s (sort of) about volcanoes, directed by Werner Herzog. It’s hard to imagine two more different films. Inferno is twisty and ludicrous, a   romp through absurdity against the background of   Florence; Into the Inferno is a loose, sometimes funny, sometimes unsettling meditation on the ways raw natural power shapes human societies, imaginations, and beliefs. In other words, it’s a Werner Herzog movie. What the two films have in common is also what separates them: Both sense that religion is a way of interpreting the world, but they approach their responsibility to that topic from opposite poles"
202889,55,tertiary,362,"   Inferno never really wanted to make sense      Rating  2     Inferno is actually based on Dan Brown’s fourth novel about Harvard ”symbologist” Robert Langdon  —   Hollywood skipped the third novel, The Lost Symbol, for reasons that don’t really seem to matter  —   and I’ll risk being repetitive to state that it’s not a very good movie. The point of this movie and its predecessors, The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, has never been to make great art. They get poor reviews and make a lot of money, and most people go home happy enough  —   including, presumably, Howard, Hanks, and whoever else is on the payroll"
202889,56,primary,380,"  As with its predecessors, Inferno features Hanks gamely playing Langdon and takes place over the course of a single day, as Langdon uses his knowledge about symbols and history to crack a historical scavenger hunt and save the world from whatever shadowy force is threatening it this time. (You don’t need to see either The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons to follow along with this one.) This time around, that threat is Dr. Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster) who in the film’s opening moments is seen giving a   speech about the urgent need to reduce the number of humans on the planet by half, so as to keep us from sending ourselves into extinction. He, as you might guess, plans to do this winnowing himself  —   saving the human race by extinguishing half of it with a virus"
202889,57,tertiary,584,"          There are all kinds of problems with this plan that Inferno never really addresses. For instance, about 95 percent of humanity will be infected, but only half will die. Which half and why? Is this selective, and if so, who gets selected, and why are people not more concerned about eugenics? Why will the surviving half not also die, if civilization is wiped out and they have to fight one another for survival? Also, if a population of about 8 billion is reduced to 4 billion, what will keep them from rapidly multiplying back up to 8 billion? Isn’t this at best a   fix?    But the best policy with these movies is to not ask too many questions  —   a bit ironically, since the movie is peppered with Zobrist whispering ”seek and find,” which I can only assume is meant to echo Jesus’s words in two Gospels. Any enjoyment derived from Inferno comes from trying to keep up with the actual plot, which contains some truly   twists but nonetheless probably shouldn’t be spoiled. I’ll just leave it at this: Langdon wakes up in a hospital in Florence with   amnesia, tended to by Dr. Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones) who helps him escape a police officer who’s apparently after him. They return to her apartment, where they become convinced the US government is after him for some reason he can’t really remember because, again, amnesia. (Amnesia, by the way, is the lazy writer’s way to construct a mystery out of nothing very mysterious.)    Langdon circuitously realizes he has a tiny device in his possession that, when sprung, projects on Dr. Brooks’s apartment wall an altered image of Botticelli’s ”Map of Hell,” based on Dante’s Inferno, which has inspired most of our conceptions of hell since. (The Bible itself is largely mum on the specific details of hell, save for some references to an unquenchable lake of fire.) In the Inferno, Dante depicts hell as comprising nine circles, corresponding roughly to the deadly sins, and he travels through those circles led by the poet Virgil (who has been sent by Beatrice, the symbol of divine love, who emerges in the later books of Dante’s Divine Comedy)"
202889,58,primary,827,"          Botticelli mapped out Dante’s circles, but Langdon and Brooks notice there’s lettering on the painting, and some of the pieces have been rearranged. That sends them off on a scavenger hunt through Florence and, eventually, Istanbul. A classic tale of   falling through ceilings, and messages hidden on the back of medieval artifacts, Inferno is an extremely silly staging of a battle between   people, all of whom want to stave off the apocalypse but disagree about the best way to do that. The movie doesn’t even bother to justify its own position on whether or not this is a good idea. And why should it? This is a puzzle box, not reality, and it’s going to sell a lot of movie tickets. I left the theater feeling like the movie I’d just seen was frivolous and poorly plotted but sort of charming in its own way, and it moved along so fast I barely had time to register another plot hole before it soldiered on to the next picturesque location. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was weird and wrong about it"
202889,59,tertiary,393,"Into the Inferno is ostensibly about volcanoes but actually about belief systems As it happened, earlier that day I’d watched Into the Inferno (in theaters and on Netflix) which organizes itself around some of the world’s major active volcanoes, from Indonesia to Iceland. Werner Herzog travels alongside Cambridge volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer, whom he met while shooting his 2007 Antarctica doc, Encounters at the End of the World"
202889,60,primary,823,"       Rating  4     After I finished the movie, my husband asked me what I’d learned about volcanoes, and I realized that the answer was ”very little.” But that’s not a complaint. Through Herzog’s eyes, volcanoes are majestic shapers of life. He films active lava flows as if they are magnificent art installations, their roiling magma and rippling cooling folds acting as tools of sculpture in the hands of the world’s most badass artist. Into the Inferno is less interested in science than it is in humanism, in prodding the civilizations that live in the shadow of these volcanoes. Every civilization has tales of its own creation and of future apocalypse  —   what if both were contained in a mountain, and that mountain loomed over your life? Imagine living beside a mountain that both gave rise to your world and could wipe it out at any moment. Would you fear it? Worship it? Sing about it? All of the above?             Herzog has never really been good about sticking to his ostensible subject. No matter what he’s looking at  —   and talking about, in the accent and intonation that by now has risen to the level of    —   Herzog is just as interested in how humans live in the midst of the world’s mysteries as he is in those mysteries themselves. Cave paintings, grizzly bears, death row inmates, the internet, Antarctica: They’re interesting to Herzog insofar as they touch imaginations and shape civilizations, and that’s why he points his camera at them. Every Herzog movie is, ultimately, about Herzog, and also about us. There’s less Herzog voiceover in this film than usual, traded for more onscreen Oppenheimer, who talks with subjects about their lives in the volcanoes’ shadows. Some are village leaders who are comfortable chatting about their relatives’ ability to talk to the volcano but mystified by the scientists’ interest in it. The most gripping part of the film is a short but surreal section in which Oppenheimer and the crew, having been invited to collaborate with volcanologists in North Korea, gain rare access to the cloistered country, and Herzog comes along for the ride. In the first shot, Herzog’s camera sits alongside Paektu Mountain, a huge volcano that’s considered the mythical birthplace of the Korean people. A group of young men in uniform approach, marching in formation. We, along with Herzog, assume they are soldiers, but it turns out they are university students, come to pay homage to the volcano. They sing, and as they do, Herzog pans across the line of them and solemnly entreats us to consider the same spectacle ever happening with university students in California"
202889,61,primary,433,"  ”Everything we saw was an act of presentation, and we went for it,” says Herzog. ”There is no way to see this enigmatic country other than how it wants to present itself.” Soon we discover that Kim   who fought the Japanese and became the first president of the country (eventually declared ”president for eternity,” Herzog informs us) established his secret military base at the volcano, effectively   the country’s religious mythology about its own origin to establish his place in its pantheon of gods. Several guides take us around the mountain to different sculptures and, eventually, to the secret base itself, which Herzog says is a place that carries roughly as much weight in the North Korean imagination as Jesus’s birthplace"
202889,62,primary,203,"Inferno never bothers to justify its conclusions Putting Inferno and Into the Inferno side by side yields parallels. Some are to be expected: Both, for instance, rely on a lot of fire imagery, which can’t help but call to mind hell. Both talk a lot about the mass extinguishment of human life, along with the rebirth of the world. In that way, both are apocalyptic: In Inferno, Zobrist suggests we ought to bring on the apocalypse ourselves to save mankind, while in Into the Inferno, most people are aware of just how helpless they are in the face of a mighty volcano. But Inferno left me miffed because it is, at heart, a deeply inhuman story. I don’t have a particular dog in the medieval Catholic fight, though I know Brown has been a figure of controversy for his perceived   stories, particularly in The Da Vinci Code. He’s claimed they are meant to entertain and promote spiritual discussion and debate. And that’s his prerogative"
202889,63,secondary,341,"          And yet, whatever is true of his previous books and the movies based on them, Inferno is in some other category, precisely because there is nothing very spiritual about them. Set aside the   plot for a moment (which could promote conversation of a spiritual sort, however obliquely). In Inferno, the stories and symbols belonging to a faith tradition important to many people serve merely as a sort of decoder ring for a religiously tinted National Treasure. The actual meaning and content of those beliefs is excised in favor of a maudlin romantic plot and a mystery; anything that appears mysterious or supernatural is quickly explained away. It seems very strange that a story so surrounded by beauty, mystery, and gestures toward the divine could be so very cold and devoid of care for its characters. Inferno doesn’t explicitly attack the Catholic Church in any manner. But it treads all over holy and formerly holy sites with nary a moment for wonder or contemplation"
202889,64,tertiary,314,"  Sure, the fate of the world is at stake. But if you’re going to bring up hell and Dante’s Beatrice, whisper ”seek and find” over and over, and contemplate the extinction of humanity  —   if you’re going to ponder the awesome fact that modern man holds in his hands the possibility to control his own destiny instead of leaving that fate with the gods, would it be too much to bring up metaphysics once or twice to explain why humans ought to survive? Or nah? [Spoiler, I guess] That’s why it’s extra strange that Inferno never bothers to justify its ultimate position, that it would be better for humans to continue on this apparently inexorable track toward overpopulation and hellish extinction rather than go along with Zobrist’s   plan. Near the end it seems briefly as if Langdon is having an attack of conscience for realizing he killed to save mankind  —   on a smaller scale, to be sure  —   but the moment passes, and with it, the opportunity to reflect on something bigger than a puzzle. But the fate of humanity is at stake here, for Pete’s sake. And without being told that Zobrist was wrong, and without a way to justify Langdon’s decision (religious, philosophical, or otherwise) Inferno just leaves us feeling as if he might have done the wrong thing"
202889,65,primary,760,"Into the Inferno takes belief seriously, no matter how strange Herzog’s approach could not be more different. In fact, you could say that Into the Inferno is an inquiry into the nature of religion itself, and how people around the world develop the beliefs that give their lives meaning. The volcanoes are connected and give rise to the fundamental beliefs of the cultures around them, and while we could certainly just chuckle at some of those beliefs from our vantage points, Herzog won’t let us. ”There is no single [volcano] that is not connected to a belief system,” Herzog tells us  —   whether that’s magical, political, or religious. Herzog’s approach takes belief seriously, no matter how improbable or illogical it sounds to the outsider. Brown’s skims the symbols off religion for entertainment in the form of puzzles that can be unlocked in the space of a day (or a   movie)"
202889,66,tertiary,579,"           That in a nutshell captures the dichotomy of how we who fancy ourselves sophisticated and enlightened tend to handle religion. Religion can act just as a curious repository of aesthetics and symbols we can draw upon for our own purposes  —   think of how politicians and their surrogates so easily swipe biblical phrases to tug at our consciences, for instance. But people’s dearly held beliefs, no matter how silly we might think they are from the outside, aren’t really ours to use for our own entertainment purposes without even a nod to what they meant, and mean, to adherents. (Especially when your whole story is about mass death and destruction.)    That’s why Herzog’s approach is both respectful and deeply contemporary: It recognizes that belief takes a lot of shapes, not all of which are explicitly about the gods  —   the North Korea segment shows that  —   and that when we’re confronted with belief systems that don’t quite make sense to us, we might do well to just sit and listen. Into the Inferno is a strong argument for feeling a sense of wonder in the face of things you don’t understand. Inferno, on the other hand, has no sense of wonder at all, no respect for the weight of its conclusions. Cheap tricks and symbols are all it has. "

A presidential election is a reflection of the national culture and mood, and if the Obama election was a statement of optimism about the radical demographic, technological and social changes of recent decades, then what did Americans’ choice of Trump really mean? It is, some voters said, an admission of exhaustion, a collective settling for the lesser of two evils in a country where people increasingly choose not to live near, associate with or listen to those who hold opposing political views. Not quite, other voters said. With or without Trump’s extraordinary appeal, Americans were determined this year to send the politicians a message about the pain caused by a   collapse of certainties about what America looks like, what constitutes a family and how we earn a living"

By being blunt, he’s saving your life. ” Across the ideological divide, some see this year’s surly, sour campaign as a reflection of sentiments that have been plainly visible on the Internet for a long time but that just this year exploded into open expression. “Fear and anger and misogyny and xenophobia don’t change  —   they were always out there, but now those people can find each other so much more easily,” said Chip Franklin, a radio talk show host in San Francisco who built his career as a conservative, then shifted his politics to the left. “This year’s anger is the same as any year’s anger, but what’s different now is that there are 30 different ways to express that anger and share it with people who would never have seen it before. Then along came Donald Trump, willing to say whatever people wanted him to say. ” Even if he had lost, this would have been the year of Trump, a wholesale rejection of politics as usual. The thin enthusiasm for Clinton, the revival of the 1990s narrative painting her as dishonest and arrogant, and the dramatically rougher language deployed against her combined with Trump’s ability to give voice to the nation’s id. The result was a cavalcade of insults, threats and unchecked assertions flying under the flag of   correctness. The candidates took body blows from all sides, a level of vitriol that was commonplace in America’s first century but had calmed considerably during the decades when the three major TV networks set the nation’s political tone. This year, it was almost remarkable that no candidate got challenged to a duel. Congress, the news media and politicians overall  —   the usual basement dwellers in any accounting of the nation’s   institutions  —   fell to new lows. But the biggest shift seemed to take place on the smallest stages. ‘Devolving into tribes’ As Jane Beard waited for her prescription at the Walgreens in Edgewater, Md. a baby in a stroller caught her eye. She played a quick bit of    looked up and caught the boy’s father’s eye. He smiled and leaned in: “Listen, I want to ask you something. Are you a Hillary voter? You look like a Hillary voter. ” For an instant, Beard  —   in yoga pants, a sweatshirt and little Ecco shoes  —   thought the man had sensed a kindred spirit. “You bet I am!” she replied. Suddenly, the man unleashed a river of invective: “It’s     like you who are helping that     win. She’s a murderer. ” He went on, and it didn’t get any nicer. Rattled, Beard asked: “Why did you even come up to me? I never said a word to you. All I did was exist in the world in this store . . . ” “You exist!” the man hissed. “      like you exist and you’re     up the country  —   our country. ” Beard searched for the best retort. “It’s my country, too,” she blurted. She quickly left the store, sat down in her car, caught her breath and posted about the incident on Facebook. Within minutes, a virtual community embraced Beard, a former actress who coaches executives on public speaking. They bemoaned the loss of civility in so many places. They told stories of angry confrontations launched from both sides of the divide. They said they’d refrained from putting out yard signs this year because people have gotten so riled up. “Truly sadly, I feel just about the same way as this nut  —   albeit in reverse,” one of Beard’s friends wrote. “I hate that this election has brought out these feelings in me. ” But one man assured Beard that “you met an outlier. The vast majority of people are good and kind. ” Another urged her to “look at the support you have catalyzed with this post. Look at the love that holds you and everyone woven into this tapestry. That is what is real. ” Beard, who lives in Churchton, Md. near the Chesapeake Bay, had already had three Hillary signs stolen from her yard. On Halloween, she took down her latest sign, just for the evening, “because we didn’t want people not to come to our house. ” But in the week after the drugstore confrontation, Beard, 60, found support from neighbors, including Trump supporters, one of whom ran into her at the Baltimore airport, hugged her, and said, “Oh my gosh, Jane, we can still be friends. ” Still, she struggled with the meaning of her moment in Walgreens. “People are scared,” she concluded. “That man is raising a kid that will hear that language and spout that language. Yet I was soothed by all the outpouring. What makes me sad is that we’re devolving into tribes. I thought we were all the American tribe. ”     Clinton holds a rally early Tuesday morning at N. C. State University in Raleigh. (Melina   Washington Post)     Suporters cheer Trump in Grand Rapids, Mich. on Monday. (Jabin   Washington Post)    ‘Why are we enemies?’ Deep divisions and despairing dissatisfaction over politics and the nation’s direction are nothing new. “America never was America to me,” Langston Hughes wrote in “Let America Be America,” his 1935 poem. “I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart. I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars. . . . I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek  —   and finding only the same old stupid plan of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak. ” Hughes concluded that the people, not the politicians, could “bring back our mighty dream again. . . . I swear this oath  —   America will be!” That essentially American optimism has not disappeared. Many Trump supporters, drawn by their candidate’s dark vision of a lost and failing country that “I alone can fix,” thought of themselves as a movement to restore greatness. “More than anything else, Trump picked up on a growing sense that elections don’t have much impact on the direction of the country, that power is increasingly distant from the people,” said Chris Buskirk, publisher of American Greatness, a   blog. Buskirk saw Trump connecting with voters on messages that had more in common with Democrats Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren than with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( . ): border security, a “ ” trade policy aimed at “bringing Wall Street to heel” and a foreign policy skeptical of military intervention. That message  —   American jobs, America First, Fortress America  —   hit home with millions of people who have felt disconnected from, and disdained by, the elites for decades. In 1996, James Dobson, the head of Focus on the Family, one of the country’s largest and most influential evangelical Christian organizations, said: “People inside the Beltway are not aware of the multiple millions of Americans out there who believe things differently than is perceived in Washington. They’re very concerned about . . . a moral meltdown in this country. They’re waiting for some political figure to articulate those views. And no one does. ” Then came Trump. His unique blend of celebrity, ego and a mischievous delight in outraging the elites  —   as well as his confidence that he would be judged by the lax standards applied to Hollywood and sports figures rather than the unforgiving rules that govern politicians  —   enabled him to win over millions who heard in his message clear echoes of their   grumbles to friends on Facebook. Trump’s rhetoric and character liberated some Americans to open an ugly vein of animosity. “This year has revealed our underbelly, and a lot of people don’t like what we see,” said Jim Daly, Focus on the Family’s current president. America, Daly said, has morphed into “a   society,” a “depraved culture” in which the more conservative party chose a nominee who boasted of his sexual assaults"
216740,72,tertiary,337,"  At the Grand Rapids Trump rally Monday. (Jabin   Washington Post)  Clinton’s decades in politics, her emotionally distanced and guarded presentation, and her legalistic language nearly smothered the revolutionary nature of her own candidacy  —   oddly, the possibility of electing the first female president was rarely mentioned through most of the campaign. (When some in the campaign sought to go big with the historic nature of Clinton’s candidacy, they were told by those in charge that many Americans just didn’t want to hear it.)    Was the Trump victory a statement condoning sexism, boorish behavior and coarse aggression? Would President Obama still insist, as he did last summer, that “America is not as divided as some have suggested”? In recent days, many Americans expressed a palpable desire to relieve the tension of division that is evident in the 56 percent of Americans who, according to The Washington   poll, were anxious about Clinton becoming president and the 61 percent who felt that way about Trump winning. “Everybody is against everybody. Why?” Mary White asked in Des Moines last week after two police officers were shot and killed. She brought her son to a makeshift memorial, where she found a morsel of hope, and a question: “Look how this community has come together, people who don’t know each other. Why can’t our nation come together? What happened between   and now? Why are we enemies?” Every chapter in the American story so far has resolved into hope. The Civil War birthed Reconstruction. The riots and generational strife of the 1960s settled into sweeping social and cultural change. Before the vote, the University of Virginia’s president, Teresa Sullivan, appealed to students to be civil to one another after the vote. She taught them about the bitter election of 1800, when a   Adams newspaper warned that Thomas Jefferson would create a nation in which “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will openly be taught and practiced. ” Jefferson won and set about trying to get people to “unite with one heart and one mind,” to restore “that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things . . . ” Daly, the evangelical leader, said he intends to reach out to gay activists and abortion rights advocates “to build bridges, just trying to create discussions and friendships. I don’t know if it will work. When you try to do that, you get killed by the extremes on both sides. The uncorking of incivility makes it hard: Discussions that used to die among friends now become unbridled castigating of other people. I’m hopeful that this election is a blip. We’re now at a point where we cannot say that civility is a shared value, and I don’t see how we can keep our democracy together without being able to talk to each other. ”               Caption   People around the globe watched as Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States"

179349,74,tertiary,2," While he has swallowed a big budget cut, had his chosen deputy vetoed, and been dismissed as invisible in his own building, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is playing a patient game to gain influence by avoiding public conflicts with the White House, six current and former U. S. officials said on Thursday. The former Exxon Mobil Corp CEO faces multiple challenges in his unfamiliar role as chief U. S. diplomat, including a boss in U. S. President Donald Trump who makes unpredictable policy pronouncements and does not take kindly to criticism or contradiction, said four current officials. Relations between U. S. presidents and their chief diplomats have varied widely in history, but those between Trump and Tillerson are especially important because of potential conflicts between the unsettled state of the world and Trump’s ”America First” agenda, two of the officials said. As a result, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, Tillerson is trying to keep a low profile, which is his natural instinct, and seeking a way to make his case on foreign policy without being drawn into losing battles. One case in point is Thursday’s White House proposal to cut spending on U. S. diplomacy and foreign aid by some 28 percent, a sign that the State Department and U. S. Agency for International Development are not Trump priorities. On Thursday in Tokyo, Tillerson said the State Department’s current spending is ”simply not sustainable,” and accepted the ”challenge” Trump had given in proposing to cut more than a quarter of his agency’s budget. ”He is making a very sensible calculation,” said a former U. S. official, noting that Congress, not the president, holds the purse strings. ”You state your loyalty to the president, and then you know that you will not actually have to live with the president’s budget.” NO WAY TO WIN ’  ’ BATTLES Two current and former officials said Tillerson is no stranger to cost cuts, having lived through waves of them at Exxon, and they suggested that he had convinced the White House to allow him to make many of the cuts himself"
179349,75,tertiary,347,"   ”Tillerson isn’t opposed to cutting the budget at all, but he figured out that he couldn’t win    battles with the president and the people close to him, so he’s pursuing a different strategy, arguing that he can’t make wise decisions about what to cut until he’s more familiar with his department and its budget,” said one veteran State Department official. Michael Anton, a National Security Council spokesman, said Tillerson is held in high regard at the White House. ”President Trump has the utmost confidence in the Secretary of State and looks forward to Mr. Tillerson implementing a bold agenda to revitalize American foreign policy,” Anton said. While he is delaying some of the drastic cuts the White House wanted, it is far from clear that Tillerson can prevail over Trump aides such as Steve Bannon who want to dismantle parts of the federal government and limit U. S. engagement with the world, said three of the current and former officials"
179349,76,secondary,504,"   The White House veto of Elliot Abrams, Tillerson’s choice for deputy secretary, the department’s   post, ”drove that point home,” one of the current officials said. Despite that defeat, a White House official said Tillerson has good access to the president, including multiple lunches, dinners and meetings. Tillerson dined with Trump on Monday, the night before he flew to Asia. INVISIBILITY CLOAK? Tillerson’s low profile   he held his first news conference on Thursday in Tokyo seven weeks after becoming secretary of state   has brought criticism from the media and many State Department officials that he remains invisible and has failed to cultivate potential allies in Trump’s cabinet and on Capitol Hill.

187630,79,tertiary,225," Ride hailing app company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER. UL] is generating more than $1 billion in profit a year in its top 30 cities globally, and partly using that money to bankroll its expansion in China, Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said in an interview. The company said in February it was losing more than $1 billion a year in China’s   ride hailing market, where it is battling large local incumbents to win customers. Kalanick said China was the company’s most intense market, but also a crucible for new ideas that it has exported to other markets, and that its investment here was sustainable. ”If you took our top 30 cities today, today they’re generating over $1 billion in profit a year, just our top 30 cities. And that profit multiplies every year because we’re growing,” he said on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in the Chinese island province of Hainan. Other cities among the 400 where Uber operates were also profitable, he added. ”So that helps us to sustainably invest in our Chinese efforts. .. Because of the profits we have globally, this is something we can do for the long run,” he said late on Thursday. Uber and China’s Didi Kuaidi, backed by Chinese technology giants Tencent Holdings Ltd ( ) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( ) have both spent heavily to subsidize fares to gain market share, betting on China’s   transport market becoming the world’s biggest. The strategy seems to be working for Uber. The company’s market share in China has grown quickly, rising from about 1 percent to 2 percent in January 2015 to about 30 percent now, Kalanick said. China’s transport minister said earlier this month fare subsidies and the supplementing of driver wages by   companies were competitively unfair and unsustainable in the  . The San   company founded in 2009 was starting to test new products in China first and one example he noted was UberCOMMUTE, a carpooling app that was first launched in Chengdu last September and later expanded elsewhere. ”The key for (us in) China is to move fast,” Kalanick said. ”If we launch in the U. S. and then it gets copied in China, we’ll be behind. So we’re starting to orient some of our innovation at China first,” he added, highlighting the cutthroat competition. The company’s Chinese business boosted its valuation in January to more than $8 billion after raising more than $1 billion in its latest funding round. Kalanick said so far Uber had not faced major regulatory challenges in China, possibly because the government has been trying to drive innovation and Uber fits the narrative. Kalanick declined to say when he thought Uber would turn a profit in the world’s most populous country, but he seemed to be enjoying the ride regardless. ”I was in China 70 days last year and 100 times a day someone would say ’Travis, no Internet technology company has ever succeeded. I don’t know if you should be here’,” he said. ”As an entrepreneur, that’s the best thing you can hear . .. you’re always turning it into the positive, and trying to make the impossible possible is what we do. Adventure with a purpose is what we do.”  (Writing by John Ruwitch) OSLO Alphabet Inc’s  Google unit expects to receive its first wind power from Norway by early September, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.

C. where he was serving a life sentence. He was 78. Kenneth McKoy, a Bureau of Prisons official, confirmed the death to the Associated Press. The cause was diabetes and heart disease. Abdel Rahman, who was blind from an early age, had denounced secular tendencies in other Muslims since the 1960s and was linked for decades with extremist Islamist circles in Egypt and abroad. He was twice acquitted of helping plot the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat  —   whom he denounced as “not a Muslim”  —   and built an alliance with   leader Osama bin Laden while living in Afghanistan in the 1980s. After moving to the United States in 1990, Abdel Rahman preached at storefront mosques in Brooklyn and New Jersey, and came under federal scrutiny after a 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center left six people dead and more than 1, 000 injured. Several of his followers were convicted in the bombing, although Abdel Rahman was not. Instead, he was arrested on broader conspiracy charges of planning to “levy a war of urban terrorism against the United States. ”   Abdel Rahman in 1989, at a court appearance in Egypt. (Mike    Images)  Among other actions, Abdel Rahman was accused of plotting a “day of terror” in which simultaneous bombs would blow up the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels in New York City, the George Washington Bridge and the building housing New York’s FBI headquarters. “All I know is that I have nothing to do with this case other than that I am a cleric who prayed in a mosque,” Abdel Rahman said during his 1995 trial in federal court in New York. “I did not speak. I did not give orders. I have nothing to do with anything. ” Even while he being held for trial, Abdel Rahman delivered long sermons from jail, with his telephone messages amplified by microphones in the mosques frequented by his followers. During the   trial, Abdel Rahman’s   defense team included celebrity lawyers William Kunstler and onetime U. S. attorney general Ramsey Clark. The evidence included secretly recorded wiretaps, which prosecutors said indicated Abdel Rahman’s intent to wage a holy war in the United States. In the end, he and nine followers were found guilty.

He lost his eyesight before his first birthday as a result of illness. He studied a Braille version of the Koran and had memorized it by age 11. In 1965, he received a doctorate in Islamic law from Cairo’s   University, the world’s oldest Islamic university. He preached at a small mosque in rural Egypt and became known for his criticism of the secular leadership of Nasser, calling him “the wicked pharaoh. ” After being jailed for several months for his comments, Abdel Rahman spent three years teaching in Saudi Arabia, where he became more deeply immersed in a militant,   form of Islam. Back in Egypt in the late 1970s, he was seen as the spiritual leader of     a radical group later tied to terrorist activities. Abdel Rahman became an outspoken opponent of Sadat, whose overtures to Israel, culminating in the 1979 Camp David Accords, were seen as anathema to conservative Muslims. The Egyptian president was killed by assassins on Oct. 6, 1981. Although he denounced Sadat as an infidel, Abdel Rahman was acquitted of any role in the assassination plot. He later fled to Afghanistan, where he was closely allied with  ’s growing   movement. From 1985 to 1990, Abdel Rahman traveled widely throughout Europe, Africa, Asia and the United States, speaking to Muslim audiences. He spent a considerable amount of time in Peshawar, Pakistan, a hotbed of radical Islamist sentiment. By 1990, Abdel Rahman had returned to Egypt, where he was under close watch by authorities and barred from leaving the country. He managed to escape, according to one account, by being smuggled out in a washing machine. Despite being on   watch lists, he traveled to Sudan, where he received a visa to enter the United States. After his arrival in New Jersey, he obtained a green card for residency. When it was revoked in 1992, he asked for political asylum. Abdel Rahman had two wives and 10 children; a complete list of survivors could not be confirmed. One of his sons, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, was killed by a U. S. drone strike in Afghanistan in 2011. In 2005, one of his lawyers, Lynne Stewart, was convicted of providing material aid to a terrorist organization for smuggling messages from Abdel Rahman to the     organization. After first receiving a   prison sentence, which she began to serve in 2009, she was resentenced in 2010  —   to 10 years  —   but was released in 2013 for health reasons.

216781,95,primary,400,"         We don’t know much yet about what Donald Trump will do as president, but the barest outlines of his agenda are coming into view. It seems clear that Trump will pursue tax cuts, including big ones for top earners and businesses; deregulation across the board in areas such as finance; the repeal of Obamacare; more   immigration policies; and more spending in two specific areas  —   infrastructure and the military. Which raises the possibility of a nightmare scenario for economic progressivism. It goes like this: Increased spending helps boost the economy, which is already accelerating, even as Republicans give the credit for it to tax cuts (especially at the top) and deregulation, validating their narrative that Big Government under Obama is what held the economy back from its full potential until President Trump unshackled it. In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Trump promised to “rebuild our infrastructure,” adding that “we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. ” While Trump’s advisers say his plan for infrastructure spending would employ a tax credit scheme that would supposedly mean it costs the government nothing  —   which is debatable  —   it would ultimately pump a lot of spending into the economy. It’s unclear whether House Republicans will go along with the plan. As Steven Dennis reports, House Speaker Paul Ryan has made only the most perfunctory negative noises about it, and the general goal of more infrastructure spending already has the support of Democrats in Congress, so it seems plausible that Trump might end up getting his way. Trump has also promised to rebuild our “depleted” military, which would seem to mean more spending there, too. Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans have signaled that they will try to quickly repeal Obamacare, and while it’s not clear whether Trump will try to replace it with anything, he may well support repeal, as he, too, has promised to do. Trump’s tax plan calls for deep cuts across the board, including on businesses and top earners, and his transition team is already signaling he will move to deregulate Wall Street. It’s always possible, of course, that Trump will make good on his vow to start trade wars or implement protectionism, which economists have warned would prove destructive to the economy. But it’s also possible that his bluster on trade may not end up producing much, and Trump will instead govern much more as a conventional Republican, implementing huge tax cuts and running up the deficit, while deregulating across the board  —   with perhaps much more infrastructure spending than Republicans might traditionally support thrown into the mix. The Market Monetarist blog argues that the likelihood of such a scenario might be why the markets are no longer panicking over the prospect of a Trump presidency. People may be concluding that Trump will not actually make good on his promises on trade, the Market Monetarist notes, adding that they may now expect Trump to be a Republican “  Keynesian. ” Combine that with financial deregulation and Obamacare repeal, and add in some form of stepped up deportations in line with what he has proposed, and we might be getting a bit of a sense of what Trump might do. Obviously progressives would be happy to see more spending on infrastructure spending and job creation, but they would recoil at repeal of Obamacare and financial regulations and stepped up deportations. I asked Mike Konczal, a senior fellow at the   Roosevelt Institute, if he could envision this scenario, and if so, whether that might produce an economic boost from spending that Republicans could then also credit to Obamacare repeal, financial deregulation, and increased immigration enforcement (which, they might argue, helps explain why U. S. workers are feeling better about the economy). Konczal agreed that this was possible. He said such an agenda could amount to “Reactionary Keynesianism,” which essentially involves boosting the economy to full employment, but in ways that nonetheless increase inequality. That’s because it would involve cutting taxes in ways that primarily benefit the top, and boosting spending only in certain areas (such as on infrastructure and the military) while cutting it back in others (such as on the social safety yet and on other social investments that Republicans traditionally oppose, such as Green Energy). Konczal emailed: It’s possible that Republicans run large deficits on tax cuts for the rich, military spending, perhaps some infrastructure, while also deregulating finance, energy, and other industries and running a massive deportation project of undocumented workers. A nightmare scenario would be the spending from the first leading to a strong economic rebound from the Great Recession  —   what John Galbraith would call Reactionary Keynesianism  —   and the GOP and voters crediting that rebound to deregulation and immigration. You heard it here first."

Chanting “No bill, no vote,” the group of House Democrats shouted down Republican leaders’ efforts to gavel the House into session and begin conducting the day’s legislative agenda following the opening prayer and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Democrats, who gathered in the well of the chamber, began their   around 11:30 a. m. with members coming in and out to lend their support. The group grew to about 80 members by 12:30 p. m. The assembled Democrats are demanding   votes on measures that would prevent suspected terrorists from buying firearms and expand background checks. Several members also spoke in support of banning assault weapons"

212971,98,primary,374," —   Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) June 22, 2016   Democrats took turns telling stories about gun violence in their home districts and decrying GOP leaders for not holding a single gun vote on the issue since the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. “Every day we hear about somebody else being murdered with a gun,” said Rep. Mike Thompson ( .) a chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force who noted he owns a firearm. “The Republican leadership will not allow these bills to come” to a vote. Members were splayed across the well, leaning against podiums and chairs in a manner that would have earned them a reprimand if the House were in session. The   cameras, which are controlled by the House, were turned off and so were the microphones  —   leading some members to jokingly argue about who should take the next turn to speak based on who had the loudest voice. While it’s against House rules to take photos or video on the floor, at one point   carried live footage of the   via the Periscope feed of Rep. Scott Peters (Calif. ). House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) pledged that Democrats would stay on the floor until they get a vote. “We’ll be here as long as it takes, every day,” she said during a news conference on the steps of the Capitol. “This is the moment of truth. ” House Democrats appealed to    Republicans to buck their leadership and join them  —   although by about 1 p. m. none had taken them up on the invitation. They also asked Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) to come to the floor. “The House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair,” said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong"

Pelosi said members were committed to holding the floor because after a series of mass shootings marked by prejudice  —   the recent attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando and the shooting last year at South Carolina’s predominantly African American Emanuel AME church  —   and homeland security concerns, members had reached a breaking point. House Democrats are trying to stay “in sync” with the Senate in making their demands, Pelosi explained. That’s why the only two measures they are specifically demanding votes on would prevent suspected terrorists on the government’s watch lists from purchasing firearms and expand background checks. The Senate considered proposals on these two issues earlier this week. “The others, we can’t say 85 to 90 percent of the public support,” Pelosi explained, adding that the chances of passing an assault weapons ban in this Congress are “hopeless. ” “But the other two shouldn’t be, because they are bipartisan,” Pelosi said. Several Democratic senators, including Bill Nelson of Florida, Chris Coons of Delaware, Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, came to the House to join the  . Some snapped photos of the gathering as it entered its third hour. The gathering turned somber at times. At one point, Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn ( . C.) offered a prayer.

Bobby Rush ( .) spoke about his son who was fatally shot in 1999. “It’s time to end this chorus of primal screams” from mothers finding out their children have been killed by guns, he said. One such mother, Nardyne Jefferies of Washington, D. C. spoke at the end of the news conference, addressing Ryan and demanding a vote. She held up a graphic picture of her wounded daughter, Brishell Jones, who was killed at age sixteen during a 2010 shooting on South Capitol Street. [D.
